1,Co-creation of Research and Design During a Coding Club With AutisticStudents Using Multimodal Participatory Methods and Analysis,"Ward, Verity and Parsons, Sarah and Kovshoff, Hanna and Crump, Ben",FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION,2022,Web of Science,,7,"Participatory design aims to work with those who are often excluded from
design processes so that their interests are better represented in
design solutions. Autistic children are often marginalised and excluded
from design processes due to concerns about how their social and
communication differences may act as barriers to participation, leading
to calls for design processes to be more inclusive and examined more
closely to understand the value of participation for (autistic) children
and young people. This research describes a participatory design project
to develop a computer game during a weekly coding club at a special
school. Fourteen autistic (neurodivergent) young people, eight staff
members, four technology industry representatives and a Doctoral
researcher worked together to design, develop, test, and evaluate the
game. This article focuses specifically on the views and experiences of
two of the students, which are captured primarily through a Digital
Story. Digital Stories are short student-centred videos which show
educational experiences. We use a social semiotic multimodal approach to
analysis which does not prioritise linguistically encoded meaning,
instead recognising the importance and validity of the many and varied
ways in which students contributed to the project. The findings
highlight the valuable opportunities that participatory design processes
can provide for students as both learners and as expert knowers. It
emphasises the need to allow room for students' agency in the design
process, so that they really can have a say in the outcomes of design
and feel ownership over the process and outcomes of their research

2,Autistic youth in 3D game-based collaborative virtual learning:Associating avatar interaction patterns with embodied social presence,"Wang, Xianhui and Xing, Wanli and Laffey, James M.",BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,2018,Web of Science,742-760,49,"This study examines interaction patterns in a series of game activities
for learning social skills by autistic youth in a 3D game-based
collaborative virtual learning environment (CVLE). Researchers studying
collaborative learning have indicated the importance of social
interactions and social presence. However, few studies have examined the
relationship of avatar social interactions with embodied social presence
in a 3D game-based CVLE. Specifically, we examined avatar-mediated
verbal and nonverbal interactions by autistic youth in iSocial, a
game-based 3D CVLE for developing social competencies. How are
avatar-mediated verbal and nonverbal social interactions related to the
extent of embodied social presence? Building on prior studies on
embodied social presence (ESP) theory and the verbal and nonverbal
social interaction framework, this paper aims to explore the link
between the combination of verbal (appropriate and inappropriate) and
nonverbal (avatar proximity, orientation, joint attention and gesture)
interaction patterns and experienced ESP level. We report on the results
of 3 cohorts of a total of 11 youth aged from 11 to 14 who were
diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder learning in 13 game activities
in iSocial. The video data of the participants' screen recordings were
analyzed and coded based on the ESP theory and verbal and nonverbal
social interaction framework. Through cluster analysis, the results
identify distinct patterns of verbal and nonverbal interaction that are
associated with different levels of embodied social presence. The
findings of this study (1) shed light on the link between social
interactions and embodied social presence and (2) provide a deeper
understanding of how the unique spatial and visual characteristics of 3D
CVLE and the design of game activities in 3D CVLE may transform

association rule mining to uncover the associative rules of verbal
social interaction and nonverbal social interaction contributors from
the large dataset of the coded social behaviors. By comparing the rules
across the game and nongame activities, we found a significant
difference in youth with ASD's social performance. The results of the
group comparison study indicated that the co-occurrence of verbal and
nonverbal behaviors is much stronger in the game-based learning
activities. The game activities also yielded more diverse social
interaction behavior patterns. On the other hand, in the nongame

A SAR called EVA (Embodied Voice Assistant) is an open-source robotics platform intended to serve as a tool to support research in Human-Robot Interaction. The EVA robot was originally developed to assist in non-pharmacological interventions for people with Dementia and has more recently been applied for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. EVA provides multimodal interactions such as verbal and non-verbal communication, facial recognition and light sensory effects. Although EVA uses low-cost hardware and open-source software, it is not always possible, or practical, to have a physical robot at hand, particularly during rapid iterative cycles of design and evaluation of therapies. Thus, our motivation to develop a simulator that allows testing the scripts of therapies to be enacted by the EVA robot. This work proposes EvaSIM (EVA Robot Simulator), a simulator that can interpret an EVA script code and emulate the multimodal interaction capabilities of the physical robot, such as Text-To-Speech, facial expression recognition, controlling light sensory effects, etc. Several EVA scripts were run using the simulator attesting that they have the same behaviour as the physical robot.

Numerous studies have reported the positive impact of serious games on the learning process for individuals with autism. However, many of these games do not utilize techniques known to be effective when teaching this specific audience, such as those based on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). ABA is a behavioral science approach that employs error-free, intensive, and individualized teaching methods, with the goal of promoting independence in the individual. Therefore, this article focuses on incorporating ABA elements into serious games for this target audience, by introducing a Game Design Document (GDD) model that encompasses a set of learning characteristics based on ABA principles. The aim is to provide guidance to designers take these characteristics into consideration in the development of serious games. To validate the model, we conducted two surveys: one involving 15 ABA therapists to validate the ABA characteristics, and another involving 18 game developers to validate the information and organization of the GDD itself. The evaluation results demonstrate that the created model contains information consistent with ABA therapeutic interventions and that it offers valuable insights for serious game designers.

Engaging in joint attention, which is the shared focus of two individuals on some object of interest, is a strong cue of typically developing children, and the lack thereof can be an indicator of autism spectrum disorder or other pervasive developmental disorder. Therefore, the goal of many psychology experiments with children is to determine when, for how long, and towards what the child looks after some bid for attention or reaction. While much research looks for the orientation of faces based on frontal or profile pictures, or non-morphable, larger objects like cars, fewer studies work in the setting of minimally-invasive overhead person gaze or orientation detection. To automatically detect the child's orientation during a human-robot interaction experiment, we mount a camera on the ceiling of a child development laboratory and analyze the video footage. We use multiple kernel learning on eight potential orientation directions to determine a child's orientation during the video recorded interaction.

14,"Animating DGBL in Pre-School, Primary and Special Education: Three CaseStudies","Florou, Dimitra and Mavroudi, Charalambia and Haidi, Irini and Gouscos,Dimitris and Meimaris, Michael",,2009,Web of Science,124-134,,"This paper reports on three digital GBL pilots which have taken place,
respectively, in pre-school, primary school and special education
settings, for project assignments of the ``ICT in Education{''} MSc
program jointly run by the University of Athens, the University of
Thessaly and the Technological Educational Institute of Piraeus, Greece.
The pilots reported have involved 9 educators and 44 students in total
and have been based on freeware micro-games, some new games developed
from scratch as well as the ``Magic Potion{''} digital adventure tale
developed by the University of Athens Laboratory of New Technologies in
Communication, Education and the Mass Media within the EPINOISI project.
Interventions have focused on animating the application of DGBL material
in class and effectively documenting student reactions and attitudes.
Conclusions have been drawn on the learning potential of successfully
animated DGBL interventions and on the expectations of young learners
towards the games employed. The first pilot concerns a pre-school
intervention for learning basic math concepts. Four sessions have been
organised with the participation of 10 pre-school students, using
freeware micro-games from the Up To Ten and Poisson Rouge web sites and
the Minisebran suite, as well as a simple Flash game designed ad hoc. A
prototype code of conduct during gameplay has been put in place and a
number of conclusions have been drawn by observing and evaluating
student reactions and opinions, expressed by the students through
drawing and talking about their likes and dislikes. The second pilot has
involved application of DGBL material on linguistic topics, in order to
investigate whether digital games can enhance the
functional-communicational perspective of language. The intervention
involved two primary schools with a group of 15 students each, and
observation/discussion were employed for evaluating results. Conditions
of communication were created in which the students used the language,
collaborated to seek clues and information, formulated and evaluated
hypotheses and expressed opinions. During the last part of the pilot
each student group was asked to describe a language game that would
serve as a challenge for the other group, and two such prototype games
were developed in Flash. This activity gave the students the opportunity
to express themselves and apply their knowledge on structure and use of
written language, while at the same time providing a frame of
communication and ``competition{''} between the two schools. The third
intervention focused on DGBL material for children with autism disorders
(AD). Four children with AD were given access to DGBL material in order
to investigate the potential of digital games to activate their
attention, bring a playful character to the learning process and make
more amusing the achievement of objectives. The material employed
includes online freeware games and commercial edutainment software, as
well as parts of the ``Magic Potion{''} digital adventure tale, whereas
the educators created an additional Flash game for social/emotional
skills. A number of remarkable outcomes have been observed during this
pilot, whereas interesting issues were highlighted regarding game
usability, student collaboration and the role of the educators.",Proceedings Paper,,,"Florou, Dimitra; Mavroudi, Charalambia; Haidi, Irini; Gouscos, Dimitris; Meimaris, Michael, Natl \& Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Athens, Greece.",,Digital games-based learning; case studies; pre-school; primary school;special education,ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,,English,"3rd European Conference on Games Based Learning, FH Joanneum Univ ApplSci, Graz, AUSTRIA, OCT 12-13, 2009",Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse,"45525,73089","45599,99721",daianemuz,daianemuz,Rejected
15,Computer expression recognition toolbox,"Bartlett, Marian and Littlewort, Gwen and Wu, Tingfan and Movellan, Javier","2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, FG 2008",2008,Scopus,,,"We present a live demo of the Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT) developed at University of California, San Diego. CERT measures facial expressions in real-time, and codes them with respect to expressions of basic emotion, as well as over 20 facial actions from the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman & Friesen, 1978). Head pose (yaw, pitch, and roll) is also detected using an algorithm presented at this conference (Whitehill & Movellan, 2008). A sample output is shown in Figure 1. This system was employed in some of the earliest experiments in which spontaneous behavior was analyzed with automated expression recognition to extract new information about facial expression that was previously unknown (Bartlett et al., 2008). These experiments addressed automated discrimination of posed from genuine expressions of pain, and automated detection of driver drowsiness. The analysis revealed information about facial behavior during these conditions that were previously unknown, including the coupling of movements. Automated classifiers were able to differentiate real from fake pain significantly better than naÃ¯ve human subjects, and to detect driver drowsiness above 98% accuracy. Another experiment showed that facial expression was able to predict perceived difficulty of a video lecture and preferred presentation speed (Whitehill et al., 2008). CERT is also being employed in a project to give feedback on facial expression production to children with autism. A prototype game, called SmileMaze, requires the player to produce a smile to enable a character to pass though doors and obtain rewards (Tanaka et al., 2008). Statistical pattern recognition on large quantities of video data can reveal emergent behavioral patterns that previously would have required hundreds of coding hours by human experts, and would be unattainable by the nonexpert. Moreover, automated facial expression analysis will enable investigations into facial expression dynamics that were previously intractable by human coding because of the time required to code intensity changes. The technical approach to CERT is a texture-based discriminative approach. Such approaches have proven highly robust and fast for face detection and tracking (e.g. Viola & Jones, 2001). Face and detection and detection of internal facial features is first performed on each frame using boosting techniques in a generative framework (Fasel et al.) extending work by Viola and Jones (2001). Enhancements to Viola and Jones include employing Gentleboost instead of AdaBoost, smart feature search, and a novel cascade training procedure, combined in a generative framework. The automatically located faces are then rescaled to 96Ã96 pixels. The typical distance between the centers of the eyes is roughly 48 pixels. Faces are then aligned using a fast least squares fit on the detected features, and then passed through a bank of Gabor filters 8 orientations and 9 spatial frequencies (2:32 pixels per cycle at 1/2 octave steps). Output magnitudes were then normalized and passed to the facial action classifiers. Facial action detectors were then developed by training separate support vector machines to detect the presence or absence of each facial action.

16,People Skills of Behavior Analysts as Co-designers with Autistic Adults: Applied Behavior Analysis Integrated into Virtual Reality Game-Based Intervention Supports,"Rojas, Javier Alejandro",People Skills for Behavior Analysts,2023,Scopus,316 â 326,,"This chapter aims to illustrate with varied examples how behavior analysts may use people skills to support an active role of autistic adults in co-designing virtual reality game-based intervention programs. The autistic adults-centered design is presented as the core method to effectively integrate applied behavior analysis principles into technology-based support co-designed for in-game assessment and intervention. This method for co-designing technology-based supports may allow behavior analysts to develop people skills for scaffolding autistic adultsâ preferences and choice-related skills. Problem-solving is people skills that behavior analysts may develop to effectively integrate antecedent-based strategies and consequence-based interventions to meet autistic adultsâ needs for learning through technology-based supports. Behavior analysts may use problem-solving skills such as inspiration, imagination, and mind mapping to design choice opportunities that integrate antecedent-behavior-consequence strategies into virtual reality game-based learning. Designing these in-game choice opportunities may increase the engagement of autistic adults in learning and empower them throughout intervention programs by improving their decision-making skills. Behavior analysts also may develop communication, leadership and teamwork skills such as artistic sense, brainstorming, and experimentation to discover and craft with autistic adults the most engaging game mechanisms that motivate them to learn through virtual reality-game-based intervention programs. Finally, innovation and troubleshooting are essential people skills that behavior analysts may use to integrate practitionersâ decision-making models into evaluation functions programmed in the game architecture to identify, measure, evaluate, and intervene in target behaviors. In conclusion, the autistic adults-centered method to co-design virtual reality-game-based support for assessment and intervention programs provides innumerable learning opportunities for behavior analysts to develop practical people skills to perform active roles as technology-based support co-designers.

Since children with the oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) often have problems in social skills, using video games designed to improve emotion regulation, has attracted many researchers treating other groups of children with special needs, since these games can be used with or without the therapist presence; and this would save money and energy. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of EmoGalaxy, a video game, designed to improve emotion regulation, on the social skills of elementary school girls with ODD. The effectiveness of this intervention was evaluated by quasi-experimental research with a pretest-posttest and a control group. 12 students in the experimental group participated in this program, and the control group did not receive any treatment and received the intervention after the experimental group intervention period. The instruments used in this study were the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI-4) and DSM-5 Checklist.

25,Monitoring of autonomic response to sociocognitive tasks duringtreatment in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders by wearabletechnologies: A feasibility study,"Di Palma, Simone and Tonacci, Alessandro and Narzisi, Antonio andDomenici, Claudio and Pioggia, Giovanni and Muratori, Filippo andBilleci, Lucia and MICHELANGELO Study Grp",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,2017,Web of Science,143-152,85,"Background: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) represent a heterogeneous
set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairments in
social domain, where the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an
important role. Several researchers have studied the ANS in ASD, during
specific cognitive or sensory stimuli while few studies have examined
response during social interactions. Wearable technologies can be very
helpful in monitoring autonomic response in children with ASD in
semi-naturalistic setting. The novelty of this study is to use such
technologies to acquire physiological signals during therapeutic
sessions supported by interactive ``serious games{''} and to correlate
the ANS response to the engagement of the child during sociocognitive
tasks for an evaluation of the treatment effect and for the
personalization of the therapy.
Method: A wearable chest belt for electrocardiographic (ECG) signal
recording was used and specific algorithms for the extraction of
clinically relevant features (Heart Rate - HR, Root Mean Square of the
Successive Differences - RMSSD and Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia - RSA)
were developed. Sociocognitive tasks were mediated by ``serious
games{''} implemented on two tablets, which allowed a precise coding of
the behaviors of the children. A longitudinal assessment of the
physiological response of the children during six months of treatment
was performed.
Results: A link between physiological response, i.e. decrease in RMSSD
and RSA, and engagement of the children during sociocognitive tasks was
found. Longitudinal changes in the children's autonomic response,
including a decrease of RSA during the engagement throughout the
therapeutic sessions, were found.
Conclusions: These results foster the feasibility of this methodology to
be applied in a clinical setting for the monitoring of the ANS response
of children with ASD during treatment. A larger sample of patients is
needed to confirm these preliminary findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

26,Automated and scalable Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI)in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder using a single 2D camera: Apilot study,"Lidstone, Daniel E. and Rochowiak, Rebecca and Pacheco, Carolina andTuncgenc, Bahar and Vidal, Rene and Mostofsky, Stewart H.",RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS,2021,Web of Science,,87,"Background: Motor imitation difficulties are pervasive in children with
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Previous research demonstrated the
validity and reliability of an algorithm called Computerized Assessment
of Motor Imitation (CAMI) using 3D depth cameras. However, incorporating
CAMI into serious games and making it accessible in clinic and home
settings requires a more scalable approach that uses ``off-the-shelf{''}
2D cameras.
Method: In a brief (one-minute) task, children (23 ASD, 17 typically
developing {[}TD]) imitated a model's dance movements while
simultaneously being recorded using Kinect Xbox motion tracking
technology (Kinect 3D) and a single 2D camera. Pose-estimation software
(OpenPose 2D) was used on the 2D camera video to fit a skeleton to the
imitating child. Motor imitation scores computed from the fully
automated OpenPose 2D CAMI method were compared to scores computed from
the Kinect 3D CAMI and Human Observation Coding (HOC) methods.
Results: Motor imitation scores obtained from the OpenPose 2D CAMI
method were significantly correlated with scores obtained from the
Kinect 3D CAMI method (r(40) = 0.82, p < 0.001) and the HOC method
(r(40) = 0.80, p < 0.001). Both 2D and 3D CAMI methods showed better
discriminative ability than the HOC, with the Kinect 3D CAMI method
outperforming the OpenPose 2D CAMI method (area under ROC curve (AUC):
AUC(HOC) = 0.799, AUC(2D-CAMI) = 0.876, AUC3(D-CAMI )= 0.94). Finally,
all motor imitation scores were significantly associated with the
socialcommunication impairment (all p <= 0.003).

social communication and language in addition to behavioral concerns
such as noncompliance to maternal requests. Mothers vary in how they
pose requests to their children, and contextual demands may also be a
factor in compliance. This study examined the relationships between
maternal requesting be-haviors, maternal responsivity, child compliance,
and task demands in adolescent males with FXS.Methods: 35 mother-son
dyads completed three interactive tasks during in-home visits (puzzle,
iPad games, snack). The adolescents also completed assessments of
language and autism symp-toms. The three interactive tasks were
video-recorded, and behavior-by-behavior coding and transcription was
completed.Results: Comparing between tasks, mothers requested a behavior
most often during the snack task and used a higher proportion of
indirect requests during the iPad task. Adolescents were largely
compliant across tasks, with average compliance equal to 70\%.
Adolescent compliance was predicted by maternal request frequency such
that mothers who used more requests had adolescent sons who were less
compliant. Maternal responsivity was higher for mothers of ado-lescents
with FXS-only compared to those with FXS and high autism
symptoms.Conclusions and implications: Task demands may have influenced
maternal requesting, which in turn may have impacted adolescent

28,Stress and Coping in Autistic Young Adults,"Cheak-Zamora, Nancy and Odunleye, Olakunle",AUTISM IN ADULTHOOD,2022,Web of Science,193-202,4,"Community brief Why is this an important issue?Few studies have examined
what autistic young adults go through as they move from childhood to
adulthood. Moving from high school to more adult duties is stressful for
all young adults. It is unclear how autistic young adults deal with
these changes. What was the purpose of this study?We wanted to better
understand the experiences, stressors, supports, and coping styles of
autistic young adults as they move from childhood to adulthood. What did
the researchers do?We asked autistic young adults to describe their
experiences, stressors, and how they cope as they age from teen years to
adulthood. Fifteen autistic young adults were interviewed through Google
Document or in-person interviews. To analyze the data, three researchers
read each interview to find ideas and experiences those young adults
shared. The researchers met many times to discuss the shared ideas and
experiences they found. Researchers discussed these ideas until they
agreed on what the main shared ideas (or themes) were. Two researchers
then reread all the interviews to match ideas with the interview quote.
What were the results of the study?Researchers found three ideas (or
themes) that all or most autistic young adults talked about. (1) Young
adults said that they felt stress in physical and emotional ways. (2)
Dealing with new responsibilities, many responsibilities, and
relationship problems were their main causes of stress. (3) Autistic
young adults said that they had different ways of dealing with their
stress. Some young adults used meditation and others played games on
their computers or phones or looked at pictures to deal with stress.
Many young adults also said that they get help from family and friends
when they are stressed out. What do these findings add to what was
already known?These findings help us better understand what stressors
autistic young adults had and how they deal with this stress. Most
studies ask caregivers questions about their young adults. Learning
about stressors and ways to deal with stress using the young adult's own
words is an addition to what we previously knew or what was published.
Furthermore, the use of Google Doc discussions to collect data is new
and was a good method of data collection. What are potential weaknesses
in the study?We only had 15 autistic young adults agree to be in the
study, and most were white and male. Young adults with severe
communication limits were not able to be in the study. How will these
findings help autistic adults now or in the future?We know more about
the ways autistic young adults feel stress and anxiety and how they deal
with it. This information can help service workers give autistic young
adults the support they need. The findings from this study can inform
new interventions and can help health care workers, support service
workers, and family members help autistic young adults deal with their
stress and provide more ways to deal with their life stress.
Introduction: Half a million autistic youth will enter adulthood over
the next decade. Support services to help youth successfully transition
into adulthood are limited and not tailored to the autistic youth and
young adult's needs. This study utilized qualitative methods to
understand how autistic young adults experience and cope with stress
during the transition to adulthood.Methods: The study recruited 15
autistic young adults aged 18-25 years. Each participant completed a
short demographic survey and individual interview. Interviews were
conducted online via Google Docs or in-person based on the participants'
preference. Three researchers organized and coded the data using a
thematic approach.Results: Based on our analysis, three themes emerged.
Within the first theme, young adults in this study described

Taking these students into account, this research designed a digital mobile device application, named Fun Ocean, for a group of children between ages 6 and 12 with different levels of disability. Participants identify a list of marine animals using figure recognition techniques. Fun Ocean allows participants to interact with the iPad via finger touch and shaking the G sensor device to transfer marine animals from one iPad to another, which motivates them to learn about the defensive and offensive functions of marine animals.

30,Mixed reality or LEGO game play? Fostering social interaction in children with Autism,"Sayis, Batuhan and Ramirez, Rafael and Pares, Narcis",Virtual Reality,2022,Scopus,771 â 787,26,"This study extends the previous research in which it has been shown that a mixed reality (MR) system fosters social interaction behaviours (SIBs) in children with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). When comparing this system to a LEGO-based non-digital intervention, it has been observed that an MR system effectively mediates a face-to-face play session between a child with ASC and a child without ASC providing new specific advantageous properties (e.g. not being a passive tool, not needing to be guided by the therapist). Considering the newly collected multimodal data totaling to 72 children (36 trials of dyads, child with ASC/child without ASC), a first goal of the present study is to apply detailed statistical inference and machine learning techniques to extensively evaluate the overall effect of this MR system, when compared to the LEGO condition. This goal also includes the analysis of psychophysiological data and allows the context-driven triangulation of the multimodal data which is operationalized by (i) video-coding of SIBs, (ii) psychophysiological data, and (iii) system logs of user-system events. A second goal is to show how SIBs, taking place in these experiences, are influenced by the internal states of the users and the system. SIBs were measured by video-coding overt behaviours (Initiation, Response and Externalization) and with self-reports. Internal states were measured using a wearable device designed by the FuBIntLab (Full-Body Interaction Lab) to acquire: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA) data. Affective sliders and State Trait Anxiety Scale questionnaires were used as self-reports. Repeated-measures design was chosen with two conditions, the MR environment and the traditional therapy LEGO. The results show that the MR system has a positive effect on SIBs when compared to the LEGO condition, with an added advantage of being more flexible.

Since 2003, a structured group training programme on social skills for children and adolescents with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome has been developed and conducted at our department. The training programme focuses on the main deficits of those disorders. Thus, the primary goal is to improve communication and interaction skills. Method: Participants are children and adolescents without significant cognitive and language delays. Principles of intervention include structured formats, combination of theoretical and practical elements, predictable rules, consideration of individual difficulties, and sequential and progressive learning. Techniques range from structured games, the training of affect recognition, group activities, role play, team discussions, and feedback to homework using a newly designed manual on our group-based social skill training programme and curriculum. Generally, three groups of 5-7 participants each and of different age range (children, adolescents) meet weekly / biweekly for 1-1.5 hours (excluding the holidays). Two trainers - who change during the programme - carry out each of the sessions. Trainers meet regularly with the parents to discuss experiences and to provide details of the programme. Results: Acceptance by and satisfaction with the programme are high among participants, as is the mutual recognition of and tolerance of their respective problems. Both feedback from parents and trainers' clinical impressions indicate distinct improvement of verbalization and contact abilities. Participants seem to benefit particularly from role play. Conclusions: Quantitative measures (impressions of the participants, their parents and their trainers with regard to change in behaviour skills) suggest mounting interaction, communication, and problem-solving skills during the group treatment. An ongoing pilot evaluation also includes measurements of effects in everyday settings. Depending on the results, the training subsequently could be conducted and evaluated in groups with both pervasive developmental, as well as other psychiatric disorders.

32,Identifying the Essential Components of Strength-based Technology Clubs for Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Jones, Matthew and Falkmer, Marita and Milbourn, Ben and Tan, Tele and BÃ¶lte, Sven and Girdler, Sonya",Developmental Neurorehabilitation,2021,Scopus,323 â 336,24,"Background: Strength-based technology clubs for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have become increasingly popular; however, they remain poorly described in the literature. Before the impact and benefit of strength-based technology clubs can be measured, consistency in their design and delivery must be established. This study aimed to identify the essential components of strength-based technology clubs by exploring context, mechanisms, and outcomes of existing strength-based technology clubs. Method: Twenty-three adolescents with ASD (mean age 12.96Â years, SDÂ =Â 1.86, rangeÂ =Â 10â18Â years), 25 parents (mean age 46.08Â years, SDÂ =Â 8.27, rangeÂ =Â 33â69Â years), and 20 facilitators (mean age 27.93Â years, SDÂ =Â 6.55, rangeÂ =Â 20â46Â years) were purposively sampled from three established strength-based technology clubs. Data were obtained via ethnographic methods, including participant observations, interviews, and focus groups. Data analysis was underpinned by a realist evaluation, which provided the context-mechanism-outcome framework. Results: Data analysis revealed that strength-based technology clubs had four context themes (personal factors of adolescents, personal factors of facilitators, personal factors of parents, institution), three mechanism themes (activity design, strengths and abilities, environment), and three outcome themes (skill building, connection with others, emotion). Conclusion: The results highlighted the importance of understanding the personal context of adolescents, providing an individualized approach, leveraging individual interests, and modifying the environment to suit the individual. The findings contributed to defining a strength-based approach within ASD, and have demonstrated that positive outcomes can be achieved by focusing on strengths rather than deficits. Future ASD services can use the results as a framework for applying a strength-based approach. The efficacy of newly designed strength-based programs can then be tested.

33,Promoting Sleep and Balanced Screen Time among School-Aged Children withNeurodevelopmental and Mental Health Disorders: A Parent Perspective,"Blaine, Rachel E. and Bowling, April and Kaur, Raghbir and Davison,Kirsten K.",CHILDHOOD OBESITY,2021,Web of Science,329-341,17,"Background: Children with neurodevelopmental and mental health disorders
(N/MHD), such as autism spectrum, mood disorders, and anxiety, are more
likely to engage in excessive screen time, receive insufficient sleep,
and to have obesity than neurotypical peers. However, little is known
about how parents of these children approach promoting sleep and
balanced screen time.
Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with 24 parents of
children aged 8-15 years with a diagnosis of N/MHD to assess barriers
and facilitators to promoting sleep and balanced screen time. Interviews
were transcribed, double-coded using constant comparative methods, and
summarized into themes using NVivo 11.
Results: Many parents described children's chronic sleep challenges,
often compounded by screen use and no clear solutions. When feeling
overwhelmed, some parents reluctantly reported co-sleeping or allowing
gaming devices in bed. Nearly all participants reported chronic,
occasionally severe, conflict when managing children's screen time, with
some parents experiencing opposition and physical aggression. Parents
struggled to weigh the benefits of screen use (i.e., behavior
management, learning, and social connection) with the costs (i.e.,
reduced self-care and limited physical activity). To combat barriers,
parents described firm routines (i.e., ``screens off{''} time and
consistent bedtime on weekdays and weekends), moderating access (i.e.,
shutting down internet and no device in bedroom), verbal priming, and
coping strategies (i.e., music and books).
Conclusions: Parents of children with N/MHD face unique challenges in
promoting sleep and balanced screen time. Given these behaviors may
impact weight status and mental health, future interventions should
examine ways to support parents in reducing conflict while promoting
healthy habits.",Article,10.1089/chi.2020.0335,,"Blaine, RE (Corresponding Author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Family \& Consumer Studies, 1250 Bellflower Blvd,FCS FA-15, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.Blaine, Rachel E., Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Family \& Consumer Studies, 1250 Bellflower Blvd,FCS FA-15, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.Bowling, April, Merrimack Coll, Sch Hlth Sci, N Andover, MA 01845 USA.Kaur, Raghbir, Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA USA.Davison, Kirsten K., Boston Coll, Sch Social Work, Chestnut Hill, MA 0216",,autism spectrum disorder; mental health; parenting; screen time; sleep,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",2153-2168,English,,Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse,"45525,73089","45586,74144",daianemuz,daianemuz,Rejected

conditions (ASCs) and are associated with core autistic traits.
Imitating others' actions is central to the development of social skills
in typically developing populations, as it facilitates social learning
and bond formation. We present a Computerized Assessment of Motor
Imitation (CAMI) using a brief (1-min), highly engaging video game task.
METHODS: Using Kinect Xbox motion tracking technology, we recorded 48
children (27 with ASCs, 21 typically developing) as they imitated a
model's dance movements. We implemented an algorithm based on metric
learning and dynamic time warping that automatically detects and
evaluates the important joints and returns a score considering spatial
position and timing differences between the child and the model. To
establish construct validity and reliability, we compared imitation
performance measured by the CAMI method to the more traditional human
observation coding (HOC) method across repeated trials and two different
movement sequences.
RESULTS: Results revealed poorer imitation in children with ASCs than in
typically developing children (ps < .005), with poorer imitation being
associated with increased core autism symptoms. While strong
correlations between the CAMI and HOC methods (rs = .69-.87) confirmed
the CAMI's construct validity, CAMI scores classified the children into
diagnostic groups better than the HOC scores (accuracy(CAMI) = 87.2\%,
accuracy(HOC) = 74.4\%). Finally, by comparing repeated movement trials,
we demonstrated high test-retest reliability of CAMI (rs = .73-.86).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the CAMI as an objective, highly scalable,
directly interpretable method for assessing motor imitation differences,
providing a promising biomarker for defining biologically meaningful ASC

37,Applying Asymmetrical VR Collaborative Games to the Enhancement of PeerCollaboration and Oral Communication in Children with Autism,"Yang, Wan-Chen and Lee, I-Jui",,2022,Web of Science,413-426,13331,"Autism is a condition in which children are born with social impairments
in social communication, imagination, and empathy, thus, they have
difficulty interacting socially with peers or effectively interpreting
each other's intentions to engage in different social content. As a
result of these deficits, most children with autism are unable to play
cooperatively or effectively interact socially with their peers, which
makes them socially isolated and difficult to integrate into the
community.
In view of this, this study conducted an asymmetric VR collaborative
game for children with autism, where children with autism and Typical
Development (TD) children participated in a collaborative game in pairs,
and both children were required to play the game through peer
cooperation and oral communication. A total of 6 participants aged 7-9
years old, including 3 children with highfunctioning autism and 3 TD
children, were recruited for this study. During the game, social
assessments and behavioral observations were conducted by the researcher
and the therapist to understand whether the asymmetrical VR
collaborative game has an impact on children with autism in building
peer cooperation and oral communication skills, in order to achieve
outcomes that enhance social communication and trans-personal thinking
skills.
This study used an asymmetrical VR collaborative game to present the
game situation with different viewpoints, which allowed children with
autism and TD children to work together to solve the game tasks and
levels in a peer-to-peer and oral communication manner. In this game,
children with autism were required to interact socially with TD children
through an asymmetrical play style, thus, triggering the application of
peer cooperation and oral communication skills in children with autism.
In this game, the researcher used themicro-behaviors for video coding
(MBV) to observe and assess five domains, (1) mutual attention; (2)
meaningful conversation; (3) collaboration; (4) proximity; and (5) turn
taking. According to the results of this study, children with autism
exhibited behavioral orientations in the asymmetrical VR collaborative
game that were more oriented toward strengthening trans-personal and
empathic abilities than traditional solo play, especially in peer
cooperation and oral communication. On this basis, the expectation of
this study was that the application of asymmetrical VR collaborative
games had different degrees of specificity and implementation advantages
for children with autism in terms of social communication, imagination,
and empathy skills. Children with autism could learn to grasp the
meaning of others' spoken communication, and thus, develop the concept
of peer cooperation during the game, which in turn facilitated their
mastery of social skills in all aspects of the theory of the mind.",Proceedings Paper,10.1007/978-3-031-05654-3\_29,,"Lee, IJ (Corresponding Author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Ind Design, Taipei, Taiwan.Yang, Wan-Chen; Lee, I-Jui, Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Ind Design, Taipei, Taiwan.",,Autism; Asymmetrical VR collaborative game; Empathy; Peer cooperationand oral communication; Peer-mediated intervention strategies,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,0302-9743,English,"8th International Conference on Human Aspects of IT for the AgedPopulation (ITAP) Held as Part of the 24th International Conference onHuman-Computer Interaction (HCII), ELECTR NETWORK, JUN 26-JUL 01, 2022",Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse,"45525,73089","45600,86564",daianemuz,daianemuz,Rejected

recognition was administered on video-recordings from sessions of their
playing with the serious game. Results showed lack of inter-rater
reliability in human coding, confirming some advantages of machine
coding. The simple bottom-up cross-sectional exploratory analysis did
not reveal any ASC/TD difference. This is in contrast with our and
others' previous results, indicating such differences when aggregating
emotion data from wider time-windows in machine-coded data-sets. This
suggests that this second approach may be a more promising one to
identify autism-specific emotion expression patterns.",Proceedings Paper,10.1007/978-3-319-94277-3\_72,,"Gyori, M (Corresponding Author), ELTE Univ, Ecseri Rd 3, H-1097 Budapest, Hungary.Gyori, M (Corresponding Author), MTA ELTE Autism Educ Res Grp, Ecseri Rd 3, H-1097 Budapest, Hungary.Gyori, Miklos; Borsos, Zsofia; Stefanik, Krisztina; Jakab, Zoltan; Varga, Fanni; Csakvari, Judit, ELTE Univ, Ecseri Rd 3, H-1097 Budapest, Hungary.Gyori, Miklos; Borsos, Zsofia; Stefanik, Krisztina, MTA ELTE Autism Educ Res Grp, Ecseri Rd 3, H-1097 Budapest, Hungary.",,Autism spectrum conditions; Emotional facial expressions; Screening;Serious game,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,0302-9743,English,"16th International Conference on Computers Helping People with SpecialNeeds (ICCHP), Univ Linz, Linz, AUSTRIA, JUL 11-13, 2018",Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse,"45525,73089","45599,98691",daianemuz,daianemuz,Rejected
41,A pilot study using imitation and storytelling scenarios as activities for labelling emotions by children with autism using a humanoid robot,"Costa, Sandra and Soares, Filomena and Pereira, Ana Paula and Santos, Cristina and Hiolle, Antoine",,2014,IEEE Digital Library,299-304,,"In this paper we present a child-robot interaction pilot study, focusing on recognizing and labelling emotions displayed by a humanoid robot. ZECA (Zeno Engaging Children with Autism) has a special skin covering its face which allows the display of facial expressions representing five emotions: joy, sadness, fear, anger, and surprise. These facial expressions were used in two different game scenarios, involving imitation and storytelling activities. The goal of these scenarios is to help the child acquire knowledge about different emotions and to improve their skill in recognizing them. The results show that these scenarios are appropriate for the goal established for this study, and positive behaviours concerning non-verbal communication were observed. This exploratory study demonstrated the possible positive outcomes this child-robot interaction can produce and highlighted the issues regarding data collection and their analysis that will inform future studies.",,10.1109/DEVLRN.2014.6982997,,,,Variable speed drives;Games;Face;Emotion recognition;Labeling;Humanoid robots,,2161-9476,,,Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse,"45525,65922","45593,79007",daianemuz,daianemuz,Rejected

Recreational activities like games, puzzles and co-curriculars are known to provide additional opportunities for learning while also engaging the child. The proposed project is aimed to design and implement an interactive game that will help shape the behavioral, cognitive and/or life skills of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Such an implementation will be carried out using the Unity engine, which utilizes the language C# for the source code. The final result is expected to be a working solution of a game that will aid healthy development of autistic patients in early childhood, and will be deployed for public use.",,10.1109/ICECCT56650.2023.10179616,,,,Pediatrics;Autism;Video games;Shape;Source coding;Buildings;Games;autism;ASD;video games;game design;education,,,,,Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse,"45525,65922","45593,86971",daianemuz,daianemuz,Rejected

Collaborative puzzle games are interactive activities that can be played to foster the collaboration and verbal-communication skills of children with ASD. In this article, we have designed an intelligent agent that can play collaborative puzzle games with children and verbally communicate with them as if it is another human player. Furthermore, this intelligent agent is also able to automatically measure children's task-performance and verbal-communication behaviors throughout the game play. Two preliminary studies were conducted with children with ASD to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the intelligent agent. Results of Study I demonstrated the intelligent agent's ability to play games and communicate with children within the game-playing domain. Results of Study II indicated its potential to measure the communication and collaboration skills of human users.",,10.1109/TLT.2020.3029223,,,,Games;Collaboration;Intelligent agents;Autism;Task analysis;Electronic mail;Sociology;Adaptive and intelligent educational systems;autism spectrum disorder (ASD);collaborative learning;learning environments.,,1939-1382,,,Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse,"45525,65922","45681,89747",daianemuz,daianemuz,Rejected
