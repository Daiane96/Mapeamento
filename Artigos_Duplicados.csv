Because it is difficult for them to distinguish the deeper social meanings or abstract situational concepts of others in the social reciprocity process, it is difficult for them to give appropriate social responses in a specific social context. Such deficiencies will make it difficult for autistic people to establish further social relationships and social interactions with others. However, with the development and maturity of media technology in recent years, the teaching strategies of interactive technology combined with games are quite common. At present, there are quite a few research applications that use computational thinking (CT) combined with games to apply interactive teaching to ordinary children and achieve good results. However, it is curious what kind of help and influence wills this teaching method have on the social skills training of autistic children. Therefore, with a goal of using CT’s game intervention strategy to help children with ASD improve their skills in social reciprocity, this study will use an interactive game robot with CT concept on the market to guide children with ASD to develop different social skills and reciprocal behaviors and to construct an interactive learning framework for autistic children in social games through materialized operations and visual feedback interfaces.",,10.1007/978-3-030-49108-6_3,,,,,Springer International Publishing,,en,,,"45467,65933","45467,65933",daianemuz,,Duplicated

8,Applied the augmented reality technology combined with social stories strategies and computational thinking games to improve the social skills of children with ASD,"Lee, I -Jui and Hsu, Hsiu-Ting",Interactive Learning Environments,2023,Scopus,,,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involves social skills deficits, hindering effective communication and meaningful relationships. Prior research indicates that Augmented Reality (AR) games appeal to children with ASD for learning social skills but lack a structured framework and clear instructions for grasping social concepts. Therefore, this research aims to develop AR game content with a social story context and computational thinking specifically tailored for specific social situations. The goal is to assist children with ASD in mastering the developmental context and social structure of complex social situations through sequential and staged game activities. This helps children with ASD develop social skills and reciprocal behaviors. Four high-functioning children with ASD, aged 6 -9, participated in the experiment. Their behavioral performance during game interactions, learning, and social task accomplishments was observed using a multiple-baseline design across subjects. After three stages of testing and assessments, the results showed that incorporating AR effectively piqued the interest of children with ASD in learning. In particular, combining social stories and computational thinking game elements as instructional strategies helped children with ASD understand social tasks and contextual sequences. These intervention strategies also indirectly manifested in changes in their behavioral abilities and improvements in social reciprocity skills. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,10.1080/10494820.2023.2258942,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173886009&doi=10.1080%2f10494820.2023.2258942&partnerID=40&md5=4d2e66bffb80cd51fbda8a809cd906d8,,Augmented reality; autism; computational thinking; social reciprocity; social stories,,,,English,Cited by: 1,"Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.","45467,66851","45525,69257",daianemuz,daianemuz,Duplicated
9,‘We’ve got a few who don’t go to PE’: Learning support assistant and special educational needs coordinator views on inclusion in physical education in England,"Maher, Anthony John",European Physical Education Review,2017,Scopus,257 – 270,23,"Britain’s 1981 Education Act stimulated a partial migration of pupils from special to mainstream schools. The onus has since been on teachers to meet the needs and capitalise on the capabilities of pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in mainstream school settings. The research analysed learning support assistant (LSA) and special educational needs coordinator (SENCO) views on inclusion in physical education (PE). Individual interviews were conducted with 12 LSAs and 12 SENCOs working in mainstream schools in North-West England. Open, axial and selective coding was performed on interview transcripts to identify reoccurring themes. The research found that SENCOs and LSAs considered PE to be an inclusive subject, the conceptualisation of which was left to them. However, developing PE provision that met the needs and optimised the capabilities of pupils with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and supporting pupils with SEND during team games and competitive sports, were identified as key challenges to inclusion in PE. This may be of concern to some educationalists given that these types of curriculum activities have recently been repositioned at the heart of PE in England. A key challenge for all those involved in educating pupils with SEND in PE, especially teachers and LSAs, is to plan and teach team games and competitive sports in ways that meet the needs of and stretch all pupils, in particular those with ASD. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Article,10.1177/1356336X16649938,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019043963&doi=10.1177%2f1356336X16649938&partnerID=40&md5=33d235724905c764f7dbb72b4bfc6b56,,Disability; learning support assistants; physical education; special educational needs; special educational needs coordinators,,SAGE Publications Ltd,1356336X,English,"Cited by: 15; All Open Access, Green Open Access",,"45527,58032","45527,58095",daianemuz,,Duplicated
10,Co-creation of Research and Design During a Coding Club With Autistic Students Using Multimodal Participatory Methods and Analysis,"Ward, Verity and Parsons, Sarah and Kovshoff, Hanna and Crump, Ben",Frontiers in Education,2022,Scopus,,7,"Participatory design aims to work with those who are often excluded from design processes so that their interests are better represented in design solutions. Autistic children are often marginalised and excluded from design processes due to concerns about how their social and communication differences may act as barriers to participation, leading to calls for design processes to be more inclusive and examined more closely to understand the value of participation for (autistic) children and young people. This research describes a participatory design project to develop a computer game during a weekly coding club at a special school. Fourteen autistic (neurodivergent) young people, eight staff members, four technology industry representatives and a Doctoral researcher worked together to design, develop, test, and evaluate the game. This article focuses specifically on the views and experiences of two of the students, which are captured primarily through a Digital Story. Digital Stories are short student-centred videos which show educational experiences. We use a social semiotic multimodal approach to analysis which does not prioritise linguistically encoded meaning, instead recognising the importance and validity of the many and varied ways in which students contributed to the project. The findings highlight the valuable opportunities that participatory design processes can provide for students as both learners and as expert knowers. It emphasises the need to allow room for students’ agency in the design process, so that they really can have a say in the outcomes of design and feel ownership over the process and outcomes of their research participation.

11,Automated and scalable Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI) in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder using a single 2D camera: A pilot study,"Lidstone, Daniel E. and Rochowiak, Rebecca and Pacheco, Carolina and Tunçgenç, Bahar and Vidal, Rene and Mostofsky, Stewart H.",Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,2021,Scopus,,87,"Background: Motor imitation difficulties are pervasive in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Previous research demonstrated the validity and reliability of an algorithm called Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI) using 3D depth cameras. However, incorporating CAMI into serious games and making it accessible in clinic and home settings requires a more scalable approach that uses “off-the-shelf” 2D cameras. Method: In a brief (one-minute) task, children (23 ASD, 17 typically developing [TD]) imitated a model's dance movements while simultaneously being recorded using Kinect Xbox motion tracking technology (Kinect 3D) and a single 2D camera. Pose-estimation software (OpenPose 2D) was used on the 2D camera video to fit a skeleton to the imitating child. Motor imitation scores computed from the fully automated OpenPose 2D CAMI method were compared to scores computed from the Kinect 3D CAMI and Human Observation Coding (HOC) methods. Results: Motor imitation scores obtained from the OpenPose 2D CAMI method were significantly correlated with scores obtained from the Kinect 3D CAMI method (r40 = 0.82, p < 0.001) and the HOC method (r40 = 0.80, p < 0.001). Both 2D and 3D CAMI methods showed better discriminative ability than the HOC, with the Kinect 3D CAMI method outperforming the OpenPose 2D CAMI method (area under ROC curve (AUC): AUCHOC = 0.799, AUC2D-CAMI = 0.876, AUC3D-CAMI = 0.94). Finally, all motor imitation scores were significantly associated with the social-communication impairment (all p ≤ 0.003). Conclusions: This pilot-study demonstrated that motor imitation can be automatically quantified using a single 2D camera. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101840,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112500542&doi=10.1016%2fj.rasd.2021.101840&partnerID=40&md5=7b2afa142c770c873ae4854795c0da87,,Autism; Imitation; Intervention; OpenPose; Social behavior,,Elsevier Ltd,17509467,English,Cited by: 7,,"45527,58032","45527,58054",daianemuz,,Duplicated

Imitating others’ actions is central to the development of social skills in typically developing populations, as it facilitates social learning and bond formation. We present a Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI) using a brief (1-min), highly engaging video game task. Methods: Using Kinect Xbox motion tracking technology, we recorded 48 children (27 with ASCs, 21 typically developing) as they imitated a model's dance movements. We implemented an algorithm based on metric learning and dynamic time warping that automatically detects and evaluates the important joints and returns a score considering spatial position and timing differences between the child and the model. To establish construct validity and reliability, we compared imitation performance measured by the CAMI method to the more traditional human observation coding (HOC) method across repeated trials and two different movement sequences. Results: Results revealed poorer imitation in children with ASCs than in typically developing children (ps <.005), with poorer imitation being associated with increased core autism symptoms. While strong correlations between the CAMI and HOC methods (rs =.69–.87) confirmed the CAMI's construct validity, CAMI scores classified the children into diagnostic groups better than the HOC scores (accuracyCAMI = 87.2%, accuracyHOC = 74.4%). Finally, by comparing repeated movement trials, we demonstrated high test-retest reliability of CAMI (rs =.73–.86). Conclusions: Findings support the CAMI as an objective, highly scalable, directly interpretable method for assessing motor imitation differences, providing a promising biomarker for defining biologically meaningful ASC subtypes and guiding intervention. © 2020 Society of Biological Psychiatry",Article,10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.09.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096542585&doi=10.1016%2fj.bpsc.2020.09.001&partnerID=40&md5=fb2ec6cd658e0f6b7fda3bc09d78f6af,,Autism; Imitation; Intervention; Machine learning; Motor learning; Social behavior,Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Humans; Imitative Behavior; Learning; Reproducibility of Results; Article; autism; behavior assessment; body movement; child; clinical article; clinical evaluation; comparative study; Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation; construct validity; controlled study; correlation analysis; dancing; diagnosis related group; diagnostic accuracy; disease association; dynamic time warping; female; human; human observation coding; imitation; joint; mal,Elsevier Inc.,24519022,English,"Cited by: 28; All Open Access, Green Open Access",,"45527,58032","45527,58074",daianemuz,,Duplicated

This study was an initial exploration of (1) the inter-rater reliability of human recognition of facial emotions of high functioning (HF) children with ASC; (2) the relationship between human and automated recognition of facial emotions; and (3) a ‘bottom-up’ approach on identifying ASC/typical development (TD) differences, from a screening serious game context. Thirteen HF, kindergarten-age children with ASC and 13 children with TD, matched along age and IQ, participated. Emotion recognition was administered on video-recordings from sessions of their playing with the serious game. Results showed lack of inter-rater reliability in human coding, confirming some advantages of machine coding. The simple bottom-up cross-sectional exploratory analysis did not reveal any ASC/TD difference. This is in contrast with our and others’ previous results, indicating such differences when aggregating emotion data from wider time-windows in machine-coded data-sets.

15,"Transactional relationships between maternal requesting and responsivity, adolescent compliance, and task demands in fragile X syndrome","Fielding-Gebhardt, Heather and Brady, Nancy and Bredin-Oja, Shelley L. and Warren, Steven F.",Research in Developmental Disabilities,2023,Scopus,,134,"Background: Males with fragile X syndrome (FXS) may have difficulty with social communication and language in addition to behavioral concerns such as noncompliance to maternal requests. Mothers vary in how they pose requests to their children, and contextual demands may also be a factor in compliance. This study examined the relationships between maternal requesting behaviors, maternal responsivity, child compliance, and task demands in adolescent males with FXS. Methods: 35 mother-son dyads completed three interactive tasks during in-home visits (puzzle, iPad games, snack). The adolescents also completed assessments of language and autism symptoms. The three interactive tasks were video-recorded, and behavior-by-behavior coding and transcription was completed. Results: Comparing between tasks, mothers requested a behavior most often during the snack task and used a higher proportion of indirect requests during the iPad task. Adolescents were largely compliant across tasks, with average compliance equal to 70%. Adolescent compliance was predicted by maternal request frequency such that mothers who used more requests had adolescent sons who were less compliant.

Conclusions and implications: Task demands may have influenced maternal requesting, which in turn may have impacted adolescent compliance.

to encourage complex emotion recognition and collaboration between
autistic people and their peers. From its inception, autistic college
students have been involved in an iterative process to design, evaluate,
and redesign the game. The emotion recognition game has two playing
phases. In the first phase, the players independently assemble pieces in
a digital puzzle. In the second phase, players communicate in-person to
agree on the appropriate emotion for the context and construct the
emotional face for the body they have assembled together. We also
designed collaborative reward games that require the two players to
cooperate and one that encourages players to look at each other. In
order to assess the level of in-game cooperation, we added a face
tracking component that automatically quantifies collaboration and can
replace time-consuming hand-coded evaluations. We report on how this
game was designed and built by a team of autistic students, their peer
mentors, a psychologist, computer scientists, and a graphic artist.
Preliminary observations show that modeling of emotion recognition and
collaboration by peers with stronger social skills is emerging as a
central aspect of the effectiveness of our game. The participatory
process has led to several design changes including one that
dramatically increased player collaboration. We share insights and
