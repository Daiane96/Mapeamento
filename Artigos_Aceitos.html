However, these skills are often difficult to learn for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We designed, developed, and ran a 13-day, remote video game coding camp for incoming college first-year students with ASD. We developed instructional materials to teach computer programming, video game design, and communication and teaming skills. Students used the MakeCode Arcade development environment to build their games and Zoom to remotely collaborate with their teammates. In summative interviews, students reported improved programming skills, increased confidence in communication, and better experiences working with others. We also found that students valued the opportunity to practice teaming, such as being more vocal in expressing ideas to their peers and working out differences of opinion with their teammates. Two students reported the remote learning environment decreased their anxiety and stress, both are frequent challenges for autistic people. We plan to rerun the camp next year with materials that we have made available online.</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:145px;left:-1px">10.1145/3408877.3432516</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:348px;left:-1px">https://doi-org.ez31.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3408877.3432516</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">autism, coding camp, video games</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:246px;left:-1px">Association for Computing Machinery</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.</div></td><td class="s7">45525,64867</td><td class="s7">45525,6494</td><td class="s2">Accepted</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1187883087R2" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">3</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">E02</td><td class="s3">Reinforcement Learning in Supermarket Tycoon to Enhance Multitasking and Problem-Solving in Autistic Children</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">M, Joypriyanka and R, Surendran</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2">2023</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s2">234-241</td><td class="s2"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">This research investigates the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in the context of game therapy for children with autism.

Among technological solutions for people with ASD, serious games are frequently used to enhance learning of specific skills and instructional contents. However, because of heterogeneity in applications and game design, few studies have investigated their use in training daily activities. This paper presents a 3D personalized serious game we developed and validated to help ASD patients practice with shopping activities. Personalized training is paramount in people with ASD, thus several elements of this game were personalized to improve engagement and therefore the effectiveness of the virtual training. In order to assess the validity of the game, ten subjects (age $\text{11.9} \pm \text{2.7}$, 20% female) with ASD played ten sessions of the serious game, once per week. The participants underwent a real-life experience pre- and post-training in a real-life supermarket. Changes in daily living skills among participants were evaluated through specific tools: a form based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth; and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II. Significant improvements (p$&lt; $0.05) were detected in the main skills trained with the serious game, especially in learning the shopping procedure, directing attention, and problem-solving skills. These findings suggest that personalized serious games can represent a prominent tool to enhance daily living skills, but future work should clinically validate their efficacy.</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:373px;left:-1px">10.1109/JBHI.2022.3155367</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Games;Training;Variable speed drives;Bioinformatics;Pediatrics;Task analysis;Medical diagnostic imaging;Serious games;Autism spectrum disorder;daily living skills;human-computer interactions</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:122px;left:-1px">2168-2208</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.</div></td><td class="s7">45525,65922</td><td class="s7">45586,75737</td><td class="s2">Accepted</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1187883087R4" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">5</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">E04</td><td class="s3">An Android-Based Pre-Coding Method for Social Story Therapy Game Application for Children With Autism</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Atika, Syarifah and Aulia, Indra and Syahputra, Mohammad Fadly</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2">2023</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s2">1-6</td><td class="s2"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Autism Spectrum Disorder cannot be cured, but therapy can reduce the symptoms of this disorder. One of the therapies offered is social story therapy, which utilizes a visual interactive approach in which a social story, or a written narrative, is read to the children by the therapist. The purpose of the story is to assist children in comprehending specific situations or conditions they encounter. The social story game will be developed in a 2D format. The social story that will be incorporated into the game focuses on the experiences of elementary school students in their daily lives. As part of the social story game, the precoding method will be incorporated, which is specifically designed to help children with autism improve their motor skills. Using drag-and-drop playstyles, this precoding technique will be implemented in mobile games. For the game development, we will be using Unity 3D, ensuring compatibility with the Android operating system. The game was tested with observation and usability testing. Observation result indicate that the children are showing interest in learning and playing the game. For the The Usability testing results indicate a 61.35% learnability function, 62% memorability function, 72% efficiency function, and 75% satisfaction function.

This has motivated multiple initiatives, whether governmental, through organizations, or by individuals. However, upon realizing a literature review, to the best of our knowledge no initiatives that include minority groups such as those within the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were proposed. Furthermore, in this context there are no guidelines to orientate the creation of didactic activities that will bring about the benefits of CT. Due to the aforementioned information, in this article we present the definition of a collection of guidelines for the construction of didactic activities (CT4AII) that aim to promote Computational Thinking in adolescents with ASD through the construction of digital games. The proposed guidelines were instantiated in a Digital Games Programming Workshop with Scratch. The workshop was offered to four adolescents with ASD, obtaining the development of high-level CT skills and stimulating interpersonal skills that are diminished in this public. Furthermore, a posttest was executed 5 months later, with the objective of determining if the developed skills had been maintained over time. The results evidenced that the skills were in fact maintained in a sustained manner, demonstrating promising results.</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:373px;left:-1px">10.1109/TLA.2018.8358673</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Autism;Guidelines;Games;Conferences;IEEE transactions;Organizations;Bibliographies;autism spectrum disorders;computational thinking;game design workshop;neurodiversity</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:122px;left:-1px">1548-0992</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Estudos que investiguem elementos de design de jogos sérios para promover o pensamento computacional, incluindo pessoas com TEA.</div></td><td class="s7">45681,89767</td><td class="s7">45681,89796</td><td class="s2">Accepted</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1187883087R6" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">7</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">E06</td><td class="s3">Developing Computational Thinking for Children with Autism using a Serious Game</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Elshahawy, Menna and Bakhaty, Mariam and Sharaf, Nada</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2">2020</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s2">761-766</td><td class="s2"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of life-long conditions that are characterized by qualitative impairments in social interactions, problem solving and constructive skills. Children with learning disabilities such as autism face challenges in generating suitable and optimal solutions to problems. Those challenges can severely affect their interactions with others. Thus, teaching children with ASD problem solving and computational thinking skills could help them resolve conflicts that may happen in their everyday life. Effective problem solving is critical for their academic and social success and since one of the most effective tools for teaching children with autism is through using visual aids, the work in this paper reports the design and implementation of a serious game that aims at cultivating problem solving skills and teaching programming concepts to children with ASD. The presented game is suitable for children 7 to 14 years of age diagnosed with ASD to learn programming concepts.

According to the evaluation carried out in this research, the game was proven to be engaging, which indicates that the serious game is promising for teaching sequential programming concepts to children with autism.</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:373px;left:-1px">10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125196</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Autism;Conferences;Employment;Serious games;Problem-solving;Engineering education;Programming profession;Autism Spectrum Disorders;computational thinking;problem solving;serious games;sequential Programming</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:122px;left:-1px">2165-9567</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.</div></td><td class="s7">45467,66836</td><td class="s7">45467,67689</td><td class="s2">Accepted</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1187883087R8" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">9</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">E08</td><td class="s3">Developing Computational Thinking Skills in Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder Through Digital Game Programming</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Munoz, Roberto and Villarroel, Rodolfo and Barcelos, Thiago S. and Riquelme, FabiáN and Quezada, ÁNgeles and Bustos-Valenzuela, Patricia</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Access</div></td><td class="s2">2018</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">63880-63889</div></td><td class="s2">6</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">In the last years, many didactic activities have been proposed to develop Computational Thinking (CT) skills in children and adolescents. Among these activities, the digital game programming stands out as a promising alternative considering that it is related to a familiar and motivating context for students. These initiatives are not specifically aimed at individuals with special needs such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children and adolescents with ASD usually have some limitations related to communication, cognitive flexibility, and interpersonal relationships. However, it seems natural that the skills potentially developed through game programming activities are especially beneficial for the public with ASD. In this paper, we describe the offering and evaluation of a Game Building Workshop adapted to adolescents with this condition. The guidelines used to define the workshop activities are described. An assessment based on the classroom observation and analysis of produced artifacts indicate that the participants acquired CT skills related to programming at a high level. In addition, the collaborative nature of the activities offered a stimulating and welcoming environment for individuals with ASD.</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:373px;left:-1px">10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877417</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Games;Autism;Conferences;Guidelines;Programming profession;Visualization;Game design workshop;autism spectrum disorder;neurodiversity</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:122px;left:-1px">2169-3536</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.</div></td><td class="s7">45467,66836</td><td class="s7">45499,73497</td><td class="s2">Accepted</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1187883087R9" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">10</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">E09</td><td class="s3"> Design de Jogos Digitais Sérios usados para o Exercício de Habilidades do Pensamento Computacional em Crianças com Transtorno do Espectro Autista</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Katherin Malpartida and Kamila Rodrigues</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2">2023</td><td class="s2">SOL</td><td class="s2">28--42</td><td class="s2"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">O Pensamento Computacional (PC) é um processo do raciocínio centrado na resolução de problemas que envolve o aprimoramento de um conjunto de habilidades cognitivas.

Because it is difficult for them to distinguish the deeper social meanings or abstract situational concepts of others in the social reciprocity process, it is difficult for them to give appropriate social responses in a specific social context. Such deficiencies will make it difficult for autistic people to establish further social relationships and social interactions with others. However, with the development and maturity of media technology in recent years, the teaching strategies of interactive technology combined with games are quite common. At present, there are quite a few research applications that use computational thinking (CT) combined with games to apply interactive teaching to ordinary children and achieve good results. However, it is curious what kind of help and influence wills this teaching method have on the social skills training of autistic children. Therefore, with a goal of using CT’s game intervention strategy to help children with ASD improve their skills in social reciprocity, this study will use an interactive game robot with CT concept on the market to guide children with ASD to develop different social skills and reciprocal behaviors and to construct an interactive learning framework for autistic children in social games through materialized operations and visual feedback interfaces. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Conference paper</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:145px;left:-1px">10.1007/978-3-030-49108-6_3</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:286px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088497597&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-49108-6_3&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ff041484360aa3ac820ca47771f9c138</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism spectrum disorders; Computational thinking; Social reciprocity; Social skills; Social skills training</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:183px;left:-1px">Diseases; Educational technology; Human computer interaction; Visual communication; Visual servoing; Children with autisms; Computational thinkings; Interactive learning; Interactive technology; Intervention strategy; Research applications; Social communications; Social skills training; Social robots</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2">English</td><td class="s2">Cited by: 2</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.</div></td><td class="s7">45467,66851</td><td class="s7">45467,68182</td><td class="s2">Accepted</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1187883087R11" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">12</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">E11</td><td class="s3">Towards Developing Computational Thinking Skills Through Gamified Learning Platforms for Students with Autism</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Elshahawy, Menna and Bakhaty, Mariam and Ahmed, Ghada and Aboelnaga, Khaled and Sharaf, Nada</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems</div></td><td class="s2">2022</td><td class="s2">Scopus</td><td class="s2">193 – 216</td><td class="s2">456</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Problem solving is amongst the most crucial skills for this century in the workplace as well as in educational settings. Constructing and evaluating effective solutions is quite challenging for individuals with autism. This can severely affect their interactions with others. The current state of research in the field addressed in this paper indicates the lack of approaches towards teaching computational thinking and problem solving skills to children with autism. Thus, this study describes the findings of a comparative experimental research that tackles different strategies for teaching computational thinking to students with autism. This study consists of the development, design and evaluation of two gamified platforms (Serious game and block-based programming platform). According to the evaluation carried out in this research, serious games and block-based gamified platforms are both promising strategies for teaching introductory programming concepts to children with autism, and thus enhancing their problem solving. Moreover, this study presents additional user interface design guidelines for an interface for children with autism. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Book chapter</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:145px;left:-1px">10.1007/978-3-031-04286-7_10</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:534px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138139441&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-04286-7_10&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=01faf21f6e3bd53aab769f61b6a7debc</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2">English</td><td class="s2">Cited by: 1</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.</div></td><td class="s7">45467,66851</td><td class="s7">45467,68421</td><td class="s2">Accepted</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1187883087R12" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">13</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">E12</td><td class="s3">Computational thinking and social skills in Virtuoso: An immersive, digital game-based learning environment for youth with autism spectrum disorder</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Schmidt, Matthew and Beck, Dennis</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Communications in Computer and Information Science</div></td><td class="s2">2016</td><td class="s2">Scopus</td><td class="s2">113 – 121</td><td class="s2">621</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">The adoption of computational thinking (CT) has been increasing in K-12 classrooms and curricula. One population that could benefit from early instruction in CT is students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Unfortunately, many individuals with ASD lack the social competencies to successfully navigate a work environment. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a digital games-based learning intervention for youth with ASD to learn computational thinking and social skills. Dubbed “Virtuoso”, the intervention targets youth with ASD to gain social skills while working together to solve introductory computer programming problems with virtual, programmable robots. One objective is to create learning materials that embed social competency instruction within a CT-focused curriculum. Another objective is to develop an immersive space where participants can work together on curricular content.

Autistic children and their parents/guardians are not exempted. The question is how to engage the autistic children virtually. There are many online games, which can address this problem and they are very exemplary. In our small study, we aim to balance education and fun, so that learning is not too serious. We also aim to improve autistic children&#39;s computational thinking skills and enable asset/content reuse. We have reduced the degree of structure, with familiarity in contexts as affordance in four minigames: categorizing puzzle, matching-sorting puzzle, picture puzzle and outdoor puzzle. Through computational practice, we hope that children will be able to recognize patterns, improve concepts and perspectives, and perform better. We also hope to encourage asset reuse via algorithmic changes. Findings are encouraging, indicating that parents/guardians are positive towards the games&#39; usefulness and ease of use. Of special note is their preference for the learning of vocabulary and development of imagination, above matching and categorizing.  Copyright 2021 Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education.

Prior research indicates that Augmented Reality (AR) games appeal to children with ASD for learning social skills but lack a structured framework and clear instructions for grasping social concepts. Therefore, this research aims to develop AR game content with a social story context and computational thinking specifically tailored for specific social situations. The goal is to assist children with ASD in mastering the developmental context and social structure of complex social situations through sequential and staged game activities. This helps children with ASD develop social skills and reciprocal behaviors. Four high-functioning children with ASD, aged 6 -9, participated in the experiment. Their behavioral performance during game interactions, learning, and social task accomplishments was observed using a multiple-baseline design across subjects. After three stages of testing and assessments, the results showed that incorporating AR effectively piqued the interest of children with ASD in learning. In particular, combining social stories and computational thinking game elements as instructional strategies helped children with ASD understand social tasks and contextual sequences. These intervention strategies also indirectly manifested in changes in their behavioral abilities and improvements in social reciprocity skills.</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:145px;left:-1px">10.1080/10494820.2023.2258942</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:349px;left:-1px"> https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2023.2258942</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2">Routledge</td><td class="s2"></td><td class="s2"></td><td class="s2"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.</div></td><td class="s7">45489,83409</td><td class="s7">45489,83506</td><td class="s2">Accepted</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1187883087R16" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">17</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">E16</td><td class="s3">Participatory Design of a Hybrid Kinect Game to Promote Collaboration between Autistic Players and Their Peers</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Deborah Sturm, Michael Kholodovsky, Rayan Arab, David Shane Smith, Pavel Asanov and Kristen Gillespie-Lynch</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction</div></td><td class="s2">2019</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Taylor &amp; Francis</div></td><td class="s2">706--723</td><td class="s2">35</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">We report on the participatory design of a hybrid two-player Kinect game to encourage complex emotion recognition and collaboration between autistic people and their peers. From its inception, autistic college students have been involved in an iterative process to design, evaluate, and redesign the game. The emotion recognition game has two playing phases. In the first phase, the players independently assemble pieces in a digital puzzle. In the second phase, players communicate in-person to agree on the appropriate emotion for the context and construct the emotional face for the body they have assembled together. We also designed collaborative reward games that require the two players to cooperate and one that encourages players to look at each other. In order to assess the level of in-game cooperation, we added a face tracking component that automatically quantifies collaboration and can replace time-consuming hand-coded evaluations. We report on how this game was designed and built by a team of autistic students, their peer mentors, a psychologist, computer scientists, and a graphic artist. Preliminary observations show that modeling of emotion recognition and collaboration by peers with stronger social skills is emerging as a central aspect of the effectiveness of our game. The participatory process has led to several design changes including one that dramatically increased player collaboration. We share insights and lessons learned that can guide others working in participatory design.</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:145px;left:-1px">10.1080/10447318.2018.1550180</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:349px;left:-1px"> https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2018.1550180</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:122px;left:-1px">Taylor \&amp; Francis</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.</div></td><td class="s7">45525,70854</td><td class="s7">45586,75128</td><td class="s2">Accepted</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1187883087R17" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">18</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">E17</td><td class="s3">Scaffolding executive function in game-based learning to improve productive persistence and computational thinking in neurodiverse learners</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Almeda, Ma.

Many STEM interventions typically do not leverage the cognitive assets of learners [1] nor do these initiatives prioritize effective differentiated instruction and learning [2, 3]. The INFACT, Include Neurodiversity in Foundational and Applied Computational Thinking, project addresses this problem by leveraging two games, NumberFactory and Zoombinis, to build foundational CT practices in elementary and middle school learners. In this paper, we describe work in progress to design adaptive digital scaffolds that support a wide variety of learners’ Executive Function (EF) often associated with neurodiverse needs. Providing adaptive game environments through these embedded EF scaffolds may play a critical role in the ability of all learners to productively persist in the context of mathematical problem-solving and computational thinking. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Conference paper</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:145px;left:-1px">10.1007/978-3-030-77414-1_12</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:286px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118691731&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-77414-1_12&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2731a3726d2e99a2284974e11dec3296</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Computational Thinking; Executive function; Game-based learning; Neurodiverse learners; Productive persistence</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Adaptive games; Computational learning; Computational thinkings; Elementary and middle schools; Executive function; Game environment; Game-based Learning; Learning game; Neurodiverse learner; Productive persistence; Scaffolds</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH</div></td><td class="s2">03029743</td><td class="s2">English</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Cited by: 3; Conference name: 3rd International Conference on HCI in Games, HCI-Games 2021, held as part of the 23rd International Conference, HCI International 2021; Conference date: 24 July 2021 through 29 July 2021; Conference code: 262119</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Estudos que investiguem elementos de design de jogos sérios para promover o pensamento computacional, incluindo pessoas com TEA.</div></td><td class="s7">45527,58032</td><td class="s7">45586,73639</td><td class="s2">Accepted</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1187883087R18" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">19</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">E18</td><td class="s3">Informal Learning Opportunities: Neurodiversity, Self-Efficacy, Motivation for Programming Interest</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Kokinda, Ella and Moster, Makayla and Rodeghero, Paige and Boyer, D.

In this study of high school students, we use pre- and post-camp surveys to measure interest in STEM and perceived self-efficacy. Additionally, we use a pre- and post-skills assessment test to understand how informal learning affects campers’ abilities. We found that when analyzed as a group, self-efficacy and motivation did not statistically change for the campers. However, individually, campers trended towards increased self-efficacy and motivation in their skills. Our work extends current research regarding informal learning opportunities for neurodiverse individuals and situates the effectiveness of informal learning for programming and STEM motivation and interest.

In the system, the content of social stories is decomposed into social situation units with a Sequence Learning structure, different social situation judgment tasks are added into the stories, and autistic children are taught to think about the order of social events and situations that occur in their daily environment, correctly prioritize social situational states, and learn how to give appropriate social responses to others in a given situation. This study recruited three 7–9-year-old children with autism and observed the explicit behavior of autistic children during the operation of SL-ARS by micro-behaviors for video coding. After performing the SL-ARS system in an autism case, we found that autistic children performed well in understanding social situations and responding to other people’s physical behavior, as they can understand the sequence of social situations from SL-ARS, and observe the social reciprocity of social situations through the structured visual learning framework. In the process of playing, AR can improve the learning motivation and operating pleasure of autistic children to understand the social situation, and construct the relationship of social cognition and social reciprocity of autistic children into the context of social situations. This interactive learning gives them the social skills and context to develop social situations, and we believe that AR technology combined with the sequential social context is helpful to train autistic children’s social reciprocal ability. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Conference paper</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:145px;left:-1px">10.1007/978-3-030-49108-6_1</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:286px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088505670&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-49108-6_1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=26db2fb31edf52f4f4dc4d227d264abc</div></td><td class="s5"></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Augmented Reality (AR); Autism; Micro-Behaviors for Video Coding (MBV); Non-verbal social cues; Sequence learning framework; Social context interactive board games; Social interaction skills</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Augmented reality; Diseases; Human computer interaction; Social aspects; Video signal processing; Augmented reality technology; Autistic children; Children with autisms; Interactive learning; Learning frameworks; Learning motivation; Physical behaviors; Situation understanding; Learning systems</div></td><td class="s2">Springer</td><td class="s2">03029743</td><td class="s2">English</td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Cited by: 8; Conference name: 14th International Conference on Universal Access in Human-Computer Interaction, UAHCI 2020, held as part of the 22nd International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCII 2020; Conference date: 19 July 2020 through 24 July 2020; Conference code: 242149</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.</div></td><td class="s7">45527,58032</td><td class="s7">45586,73882</td><td class="s2">Accepted</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
