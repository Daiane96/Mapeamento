E01,How a Remote Video Game Coding Camp Improved Autistic College Students' Self-Efficacy in Communication,"Begel, Andrew and Dominic, James and Phillis, Conner and Beeson, Thomas and Rodeghero, Paige",,2021,ACM Digital Library,142–148,,"Communication and teamwork are essential skills for software developers. However, these skills are often difficult to learn for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We designed, developed, and ran a 13-day, remote video game coding camp for incoming college first-year students with ASD. We developed instructional materials to teach computer programming, video game design, and communication and teaming skills. Students used the MakeCode Arcade development environment to build their games and Zoom to remotely collaborate with their teammates. In summative interviews, students reported improved programming skills, increased confidence in communication, and better experiences working with others. We also found that students valued the opportunity to practice teaming, such as being more vocal in expressing ideas to their peers and working out differences of opinion with their teammates. Two students reported the remote learning environment decreased their anxiety and stress, both are frequent challenges for autistic people.

Among technological solutions for people with ASD, serious games are frequently used to enhance learning of specific skills and instructional contents. However, because of heterogeneity in applications and game design, few studies have investigated their use in training daily activities. This paper presents a 3D personalized serious game we developed and validated to help ASD patients practice with shopping activities. Personalized training is paramount in people with ASD, thus several elements of this game were personalized to improve engagement and therefore the effectiveness of the virtual training. In order to assess the validity of the game, ten subjects (age $\text{11.9} \pm \text{2.7}$, 20% female) with ASD played ten sessions of the serious game, once per week. The participants underwent a real-life experience pre- and post-training in a real-life supermarket. Changes in daily living skills among participants were evaluated through specific tools: a form based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth; and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II. Significant improvements (p$< $0.05) were detected in the main skills trained with the serious game, especially in learning the shopping procedure, directing attention, and problem-solving skills. These findings suggest that personalized serious games can represent a prominent tool to enhance daily living skills, but future work should clinically validate their efficacy.",,10.1109/JBHI.2022.3155367,,,,Games;Training;Variable speed drives;Bioinformatics;Pediatrics;Task analysis;Medical diagnostic imaging;Serious games;Autism spectrum disorder;daily living skills;human-computer interactions,,2168-2208,,,"Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.","45525,65922","45586,75737",Accepted

This has motivated multiple initiatives, whether governmental, through organizations, or by individuals. However, upon realizing a literature review, to the best of our knowledge no initiatives that include minority groups such as those within the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were proposed. Furthermore, in this context there are no guidelines to orientate the creation of didactic activities that will bring about the benefits of CT. Due to the aforementioned information, in this article we present the definition of a collection of guidelines for the construction of didactic activities (CT4AII) that aim to promote Computational Thinking in adolescents with ASD through the construction of digital games. The proposed guidelines were instantiated in a Digital Games Programming Workshop with Scratch. The workshop was offered to four adolescents with ASD, obtaining the development of high-level CT skills and stimulating interpersonal skills that are diminished in this public. Furthermore, a posttest was executed 5 months later, with the objective of determining if the developed skills had been maintained over time.

From its inception, autistic college students have been involved in an iterative process to design, evaluate, and redesign the game. The emotion recognition game has two playing phases. In the first phase, the players independently assemble pieces in a digital puzzle. In the second phase, players communicate in-person to agree on the appropriate emotion for the context and construct the emotional face for the body they have assembled together. We also designed collaborative reward games that require the two players to cooperate and one that encourages players to look at each other. In order to assess the level of in-game cooperation, we added a face tracking component that automatically quantifies collaboration and can replace time-consuming hand-coded evaluations. We report on how this game was designed and built by a team of autistic students, their peer mentors, a psychologist, computer scientists, and a graphic artist. Preliminary observations show that modeling of emotion recognition and collaboration by peers with stronger social skills is emerging as a central aspect of the effectiveness of our game.

E19,Using augmented reality technology with serial learning framework to develop a serial social story situation board game system for children with autism to improve social situation understanding and social reciprocity skills,"Hsu, Hsiu-Ting and Lee, I-Jui",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2020,Scopus,3 – 18,12189 LNCS,"This study adopts a Sequence Learning Strategy based on social stories and designs a sequential social story situation board game system using Augmented Reality (AR) technology (SL-ARS). In the system, the content of social stories is decomposed into social situation units with a Sequence Learning structure, different social situation judgment tasks are added into the stories, and autistic children are taught to think about the order of social events and situations that occur in their daily environment, correctly prioritize social situational states, and learn how to give appropriate social responses to others in a given situation. This study recruited three 7–9-year-old children with autism and observed the explicit behavior of autistic children during the operation of SL-ARS by micro-behaviors for video coding. After performing the SL-ARS system in an autism case, we found that autistic children performed well in understanding social situations and responding to other people’s physical behavior, as they can understand the sequence of social situations from SL-ARS, and observe the social reciprocity of social situations through the structured visual learning framework. In the process of playing, AR can improve the learning motivation and operating pleasure of autistic children to understand the social situation, and construct the relationship of social cognition and social reciprocity of autistic children into the context of social situations. This interactive learning gives them the social skills and context to develop social situations, and we believe that AR technology combined with the sequential social context is helpful to train autistic children’s social reciprocal ability. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Conference paper,10.1007/978-3-030-49108-6_1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088505670&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-49108-6_1&partnerID=40&md5=26db2fb31edf52f4f4dc4d227d264abc,,Augmented Reality (AR); Autism; Micro-Behaviors for Video Coding (MBV); Non-verbal social cues; Sequence learning framework; Social context interactive board games; Social interaction skills,Augmented reality; Diseases; Human computer interaction; Social aspects; Video signal processing; Augmented reality technology; Autistic children; Children with autisms; Interactive learning; Learning frameworks; Learning motivation; Physical behaviors; Situation understanding; Learning systems,Springer,03029743,English,"Cited by: 8; Conference name: 14th International Conference on Universal Access in Human-Computer Interaction, UAHCI 2020, held as part of the 22nd International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCII 2020; Conference date: 19 July 2020 through 24 July 2020; Conference code: 242149","Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.","45527,58032","45586,73882",Accepted
