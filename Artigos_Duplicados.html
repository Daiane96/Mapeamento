One population that could benefit from early instruction in CT is students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Unfortunately, many individuals with ASD lack the social competencies to successfully navigate a work environment. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a digital games-based learning intervention for youth with ASD to learn computational thinking and social skills. Dubbed “Virtuoso”, the intervention targets youth with ASD to gain social skills while working together to solve introductory computer programming problems with virtual, programmable robots. One objective is to create learning materials that embed social competency instruction within a CT-focused curriculum. Another objective is to develop an immersive space where participants can work together on curricular content. Using educational design research methods, we are developing and refining instructional interventions so as to maximize their educational impact.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:246px;left:-1px">10.1007/978-3-319-41769-1_9</div></td><td class="s7"></td><td class="s7"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Springer International Publishing</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">en</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s9">45467,65933</td><td class="s9">45467,65933</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R3" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">4</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">3</td><td class="s3">Applying the {Game} {Mode} and {Teaching} {Strategies} of {Computational} {Thinking} to the {Improvement} of {Social} {Skills} {Training} for {Children} with {Autism} {Spectrum} {Disorders}</td><td class="s4">Lee, I-Jui</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4">2020</td><td class="s4">Springer</td><td class="s4">38--47</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">The main congenital defects of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are social communication barriers and behavioral defects in social reciprocity. Because it is difficult for them to distinguish the deeper social meanings or abstract situational concepts of others in the social reciprocity process, it is difficult for them to give appropriate social responses in a specific social context. Such deficiencies will make it difficult for autistic people to establish further social relationships and social interactions with others. However, with the development and maturity of media technology in recent years, the teaching strategies of interactive technology combined with games are quite common. At present, there are quite a few research applications that use computational thinking (CT) combined with games to apply interactive teaching to ordinary children and achieve good results. However, it is curious what kind of help and influence wills this teaching method have on the social skills training of autistic children. Therefore, with a goal of using CT’s game intervention strategy to help children with ASD improve their skills in social reciprocity, this study will use an interactive game robot with CT concept on the market to guide children with ASD to develop different social skills and reciprocal behaviors and to construct an interactive learning framework for autistic children in social games through materialized operations and visual feedback interfaces.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:246px;left:-1px">10.1007/978-3-030-49108-6_3</div></td><td class="s7"></td><td class="s7"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Springer International Publishing</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">en</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s9">45467,65933</td><td class="s9">45467,65933</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R4" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">5</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">4</td><td class="s3">Towards {Developing} {Computational} {Thinking} {Skills} {Through} {Gamified} {Learning} {Platforms} for {Students} with {Autism}</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Elshahawy, Menna and Bakhaty, Mariam and Ahmed, Ghada and Aboelnaga, Khaled and Sharaf, Nada</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2022</td><td class="s4">Springer</td><td class="s4">193--216</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Problem solving is amongst the most crucial skills for this century in the workplace as well as in educational settings. Constructing and evaluating effective solutions is quite challenging for individuals with autism. This can severely affect their interactions with others. The current state of research in the field addressed in this paper indicates the lack of approaches towards teaching computational thinking and problem solving skills to children with autism. Thus, this study describes the findings of a comparative experimental research that tackles different strategies for teaching computational thinking to students with autism. This study consists of the development, design and evaluation of two gamified platforms (Serious game and block-based programming platform). According to the evaluation carried out in this research, serious games and block-based gamified platforms are both promising strategies for teaching introductory programming concepts to children with autism, and thus enhancing their problem solving. Moreover, this study presents additional user interface design guidelines for an interface for children with autism.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1007/978-3-031-04286-7_10</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:245px;left:-1px">https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-04286-7_10</div></td><td class="s7"></td><td class="s7"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Springer International Publishing</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">en</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s9">45467,65933</td><td class="s9">45467,65933</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R5" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">6</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">5</td><td class="s3">Including Neurodiversity in Foundational and Applied Computational Thinking (INFACT)</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Asbell-Clarke, Jodi and Robillard, Tara and Edwards, Teon and Bardar, Erin and Weintrop, David and Grover, Shuchi and Israel, Maya</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">SIGCSE 2022 - Proceedings of the 53rd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V.2</div></td><td class="s4">2022</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4">1076</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">INFACT aims to provide differentiable teaching and learning activities in Computational Thinking (CT) that are inclusive for neurodiverse learners in grades 3-8. Neurodiversity refers to learners with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and other related cognitive differences. Underlying many neurodiverse conditions is differences with executive function (EF). In previous research on game-based learning, neurodiverse students became class leaders in CT activities [1]. Special education teachers noted that CT practices align with strategies they use to support problem-solving practices. Leveraging these affordances of CT, INFACT activities are designed with embedded EF scaffolds to support neurodiverse learners. © 2022 Owner/Author.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Conference paper</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1145/3478432.3499044</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127378905&amp;doi=10.1145%2f3478432.3499044&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=21ddad12b201c2ed5005d4672e87111e</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">computational thinking; executive function; neurodiversity</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:183px;left:-1px">Computational thinkings; Condition; Education teachers; Executive function; Game-based Learning; Learning Activity; Neurodiversity; Special education; Teaching activities; Teaching and learning; Scaffolds</div></td><td class="s7"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4">Cited by: 1</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s9">45467,66851</td><td class="s9">45467,67403</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R6" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">7</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">6</td><td class="s3">Developing Computational Thinking for Children with Autism using a Serious Game</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Elshahawy, Menna and Bakhaty, Mariam and Sharaf, Nada</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Visualisation</div></td><td class="s4">2020</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4">761 – 766</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">2020-September</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of life-long conditions that are characterized by qualitative impairments in social interactions, problem solving and constructive skills. Children with learning disabilities such as autism face challenges in generating suitable and optimal solutions to problems. Those challenges can severely affect their interactions with others. Thus, teaching children with ASD problem solving and computational thinking skills could help them resolve conflicts that may happen in their everyday life. Effective problem solving is critical for their academic and social success and since one of the most effective tools for teaching children with autism is through using visual aids, the work in this paper reports the design and implementation of a serious game that aims at cultivating problem solving skills and teaching programming concepts to children with ASD. The presented game is suitable for children 7 to 14 years of age diagnosed with ASD to learn programming concepts. The preliminary prototype for the game gained positive responses from experts and 12 children with ASD from Caritas Egypt association and Hope Academy. © 2020 IEEE.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Conference paper</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1109/IV51561.2020.00135</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102927122&amp;doi=10.1109%2fIV51561.2020.00135&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=404f238c4deefd13bea975e1cc379765</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism; Children; Computational Thinking; Programming; Visual Learners</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:183px;left:-1px">Diseases; Visualization; Autism spectrum disorders; Children with autisms; Computational thinkings; Design and implementations; Learning disabilities; Problem solving skills; Programming concepts; Teaching programming; Serious games</div></td><td class="s7"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4">Cited by: 5</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s9">45467,66851</td><td class="s9">45467,67458</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R7" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">8</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">7</td><td class="s3">Tracking Representational Flexibility Development through Speech Data Mining</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Ke, Fengfeng and Moon, Jewoong and Sokolikj, Zlatko</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE</div></td><td class="s4">2020</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">2020-October</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">In this work-in-progress research we exploited and investigated a virtual reality (VR) based, flexibility learning environment (FLE) in which adolescents with autism use, customize, and design an assortment of simulation games that represent and exemplify the application of forces and Newton&#39;s laws of motion.

The current study findings indicated that two approaches of speech or text data mining, multi-label classification and similarity index, can act as the in-situ performance assessment methods to evaluate the representational flexibility development for engineering design and computational thinking of a heterogeneous learner group. © 2020 IEEE.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Conference paper</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9273818</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098595235&amp;doi=10.1109%2fFIE44824.2020.9273818&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=435dbbf61dc1c1a623dd592b3059d1e8</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">educational data mining; learning by making; representational flexibility; virtual reality</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:183px;left:-1px">Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; Computer aided software engineering; Engineering research; Environmental regulations; Computational thinkings; Engineering design; Engineering design problems; Learning environments; Multi label classification; Newton&#39;s laws of motion; Performance assessment; Similarity indices; Text mining</div></td><td class="s7"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4">Cited by: 4</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s9">45467,66851</td><td class="s9">45467,6752</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R8" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">9</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">8</td><td class="s3">Applied the augmented reality technology combined with social stories strategies and computational thinking games to improve the social skills of children with ASD</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Lee, I -Jui and Hsu, Hsiu-Ting</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Interactive Learning Environments</div></td><td class="s4">2023</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involves social skills deficits, hindering effective communication and meaningful relationships. Prior research indicates that Augmented Reality (AR) games appeal to children with ASD for learning social skills but lack a structured framework and clear instructions for grasping social concepts. Therefore, this research aims to develop AR game content with a social story context and computational thinking specifically tailored for specific social situations. The goal is to assist children with ASD in mastering the developmental context and social structure of complex social situations through sequential and staged game activities. This helps children with ASD develop social skills and reciprocal behaviors. Four high-functioning children with ASD, aged 6 -9, participated in the experiment. Their behavioral performance during game interactions, learning, and social task accomplishments was observed using a multiple-baseline design across subjects. After three stages of testing and assessments, the results showed that incorporating AR effectively piqued the interest of children with ASD in learning. In particular, combining social stories and computational thinking game elements as instructional strategies helped children with ASD understand social tasks and contextual sequences. These intervention strategies also indirectly manifested in changes in their behavioral abilities and improvements in social reciprocity skills. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1080/10494820.2023.2258942</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173886009&amp;doi=10.1080%2f10494820.2023.2258942&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4d2e66bffb80cd51fbda8a809cd906d8</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:245px;left:-1px">Augmented reality; autism; computational thinking; social reciprocity; social stories</div></td><td class="s7"></td><td class="s7"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4">Cited by: 1</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Estudos que abordem pensamento computacional em jogos sérios, incluindo pessoas com TEA.</div></td><td class="s9">45467,66851</td><td class="s9">45525,69257</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R9" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">10</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">9</td><td class="s3">‘We’ve got a few who don’t go to PE’: Learning support assistant and special educational needs coordinator views on inclusion in physical education in England</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Maher, Anthony John</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">European Physical Education Review</div></td><td class="s4">2017</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4">257 – 270</td><td class="s4">23</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Britain’s 1981 Education Act stimulated a partial migration of pupils from special to mainstream schools. The onus has since been on teachers to meet the needs and capitalise on the capabilities of pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in mainstream school settings. The research analysed learning support assistant (LSA) and special educational needs coordinator (SENCO) views on inclusion in physical education (PE). Individual interviews were conducted with 12 LSAs and 12 SENCOs working in mainstream schools in North-West England. Open, axial and selective coding was performed on interview transcripts to identify reoccurring themes. The research found that SENCOs and LSAs considered PE to be an inclusive subject, the conceptualisation of which was left to them. However, developing PE provision that met the needs and optimised the capabilities of pupils with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and supporting pupils with SEND during team games and competitive sports, were identified as key challenges to inclusion in PE. This may be of concern to some educationalists given that these types of curriculum activities have recently been repositioned at the heart of PE in England. A key challenge for all those involved in educating pupils with SEND in PE, especially teachers and LSAs, is to plan and teach team games and competitive sports in ways that meet the needs of and stretch all pupils, in particular those with ASD. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1177/1356336X16649938</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019043963&amp;doi=10.1177%2f1356336X16649938&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=33d235724905c764f7dbb72b4bfc6b56</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Disability; learning support assistants; physical education; special educational needs; special educational needs coordinators</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">SAGE Publications Ltd</div></td><td class="s4">1356336X</td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Cited by: 15; All Open Access, Green Open Access</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s9">45527,58032</td><td class="s9">45527,58095</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R10" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">11</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">10</td><td class="s3">Co-creation of Research and Design During a Coding Club With Autistic Students Using Multimodal Participatory Methods and Analysis</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Ward, Verity and Parsons, Sarah and Kovshoff, Hanna and Crump, Ben</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Frontiers in Education</div></td><td class="s4">2022</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4">7</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Participatory design aims to work with those who are often excluded from design processes so that their interests are better represented in design solutions. Autistic children are often marginalised and excluded from design processes due to concerns about how their social and communication differences may act as barriers to participation, leading to calls for design processes to be more inclusive and examined more closely to understand the value of participation for (autistic) children and young people. This research describes a participatory design project to develop a computer game during a weekly coding club at a special school. Fourteen autistic (neurodivergent) young people, eight staff members, four technology industry representatives and a Doctoral researcher worked together to design, develop, test, and evaluate the game. This article focuses specifically on the views and experiences of two of the students, which are captured primarily through a Digital Story. Digital Stories are short student-centred videos which show educational experiences. We use a social semiotic multimodal approach to analysis which does not prioritise linguistically encoded meaning, instead recognising the importance and validity of the many and varied ways in which students contributed to the project. The findings highlight the valuable opportunities that participatory design processes can provide for students as both learners and as expert knowers. It emphasises the need to allow room for students’ agency in the design process, so that they really can have a say in the outcomes of design and feel ownership over the process and outcomes of their research participation.

Previous research demonstrated the validity and reliability of an algorithm called Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI) using 3D depth cameras. However, incorporating CAMI into serious games and making it accessible in clinic and home settings requires a more scalable approach that uses “off-the-shelf” 2D cameras. Method: In a brief (one-minute) task, children (23 ASD, 17 typically developing [TD]) imitated a model&#39;s dance movements while simultaneously being recorded using Kinect Xbox motion tracking technology (Kinect 3D) and a single 2D camera. Pose-estimation software (OpenPose 2D) was used on the 2D camera video to fit a skeleton to the imitating child. Motor imitation scores computed from the fully automated OpenPose 2D CAMI method were compared to scores computed from the Kinect 3D CAMI and Human Observation Coding (HOC) methods. Results: Motor imitation scores obtained from the OpenPose 2D CAMI method were significantly correlated with scores obtained from the Kinect 3D CAMI method (r40 = 0.82, p &lt; 0.001) and the HOC method (r40 = 0.80, p &lt; 0.001). Both 2D and 3D CAMI methods showed better discriminative ability than the HOC, with the Kinect 3D CAMI method outperforming the OpenPose 2D CAMI method (area under ROC curve (AUC): AUCHOC = 0.799, AUC2D-CAMI = 0.876, AUC3D-CAMI = 0.94). Finally, all motor imitation scores were significantly associated with the social-communication impairment (all p ≤ 0.003). Conclusions: This pilot-study demonstrated that motor imitation can be automatically quantified using a single 2D camera. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101840</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112500542&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.rasd.2021.101840&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7b2afa142c770c873ae4854795c0da87</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Autism; Imitation; Intervention; OpenPose; Social behavior</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Elsevier Ltd</div></td><td class="s4">17509467</td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4">Cited by: 7</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s9">45527,58032</td><td class="s9">45527,58054</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R12" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">13</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">12</td><td class="s3">How a Remote Video Game Coding Camp Improved Autistic College Students&#39; Self-Efficacy in Communication</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Begel, Andrew and Dominic, James and Phillis, Conner and Beeson, Thomas and Rodeghero, Paige</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">SIGCSE 2021 - Proceedings of the 52nd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education</div></td><td class="s4">2021</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4">142 – 148</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Communication and teamwork are essential skills for software developers. However, these skills are often difficult to learn for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We designed, developed, and ran a 13-day, remote video game coding camp for incoming college first-year students with ASD. We developed instructional materials to teach computer programming, video game design, and communication and teaming skills. Students used the MakeCode Arcade development environment to build their games and Zoom to remotely collaborate with their teammates. In summative interviews, students reported improved programming skills, increased confidence in communication, and better experiences working with others. We also found that students valued the opportunity to practice teaming, such as being more vocal in expressing ideas to their peers and working out differences of opinion with their teammates. Two students reported the remote learning environment decreased their anxiety and stress, both are frequent challenges for autistic people. We plan to rerun the camp next year with materials that we have made available online. © 2021 ACM.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Conference paper</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1145/3408877.3432516</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103310176&amp;doi=10.1145%2f3408877.3432516&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0461e680e92214a3b4a81136f9ceb286</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">autism; coding camp; video games</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Computer aided instruction; Computer games; Computer programming; Education computing; Human computer interaction; Video signal processing; Autism spectrum disorders; College students; Development environment; First year students; Instructional materials; Programming skills; Remote learning; Software developer; Students</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Association for Computing Machinery, Inc</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Cited by: 12; Conference name: 52nd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, SIGCSE 2021; Conference date: 13 March 2021 through 20 March 2021; Conference code: 167732</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s9">45527,58032</td><td class="s9">45527,58086</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R13" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">14</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">13</td><td class="s3">Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation as a Scalable Method for Distinguishing Children With Autism</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Tunçgenç, Bahar and Pacheco, Carolina and Rochowiak, Rebecca and Nicholas, Rosemary and Rengarajan, Sundararaman and Zou, Erin and Messenger, Brice and Vidal, René and Mostofsky, Stewart H.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging</div></td><td class="s4">2021</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4">321 – 328</td><td class="s4">6</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Background: Imitation deficits are prevalent in autism spectrum conditions (ASCs) and are associated with core autistic traits. Imitating others’ actions is central to the development of social skills in typically developing populations, as it facilitates social learning and bond formation. We present a Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI) using a brief (1-min), highly engaging video game task. Methods: Using Kinect Xbox motion tracking technology, we recorded 48 children (27 with ASCs, 21 typically developing) as they imitated a model&#39;s dance movements. We implemented an algorithm based on metric learning and dynamic time warping that automatically detects and evaluates the important joints and returns a score considering spatial position and timing differences between the child and the model. To establish construct validity and reliability, we compared imitation performance measured by the CAMI method to the more traditional human observation coding (HOC) method across repeated trials and two different movement sequences. Results: Results revealed poorer imitation in children with ASCs than in typically developing children (ps &lt;.005), with poorer imitation being associated with increased core autism symptoms. While strong correlations between the CAMI and HOC methods (rs =.69–.87) confirmed the CAMI&#39;s construct validity, CAMI scores classified the children into diagnostic groups better than the HOC scores (accuracyCAMI = 87.2%, accuracyHOC = 74.4%). Finally, by comparing repeated movement trials, we demonstrated high test-retest reliability of CAMI (rs =.73–.86). Conclusions: Findings support the CAMI as an objective, highly scalable, directly interpretable method for assessing motor imitation differences, providing a promising biomarker for defining biologically meaningful ASC subtypes and guiding intervention. © 2020 Society of Biological Psychiatry</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.09.001</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096542585&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.bpsc.2020.09.001&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fb2ec6cd658e0f6b7fda3bc09d78f6af</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism; Imitation; Intervention; Machine learning; Motor learning; Social behavior</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Humans; Imitative Behavior; Learning; Reproducibility of Results; Article; autism; behavior assessment; body movement; child; clinical article; clinical evaluation; comparative study; Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation; construct validity; controlled study; correlation analysis; dancing; diagnosis related group; diagnostic accuracy; disease association; dynamic time warping; female; human; human observation coding; imitation; joint; mal</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Elsevier Inc.</div></td><td class="s4">24519022</td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Cited by: 28; All Open Access, Green Open Access</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s9">45527,58032</td><td class="s9">45527,58074</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R14" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">15</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">14</td><td class="s3">Automated vs human recognition of emotional facial expressions of high-functioning children with autism in a diagnostic-technological context: Explorations via a bottom-up approach</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Gyori, Miklos and Borsos, Zsófia and Stefanik, Krisztina and Jakab, Zoltán and Varga, Fanni and Csákvári, Judit</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</div></td><td class="s4">2018</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4">466 – 473</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10896 LNCS</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Early detection of autism spectrum conditions (ASC) is an important goal. Automated facial expression recognition is a promising approach and has implications for assistive and educational technologies, too. This study was an initial exploration of (1) the inter-rater reliability of human recognition of facial emotions of high functioning (HF) children with ASC; (2) the relationship between human and automated recognition of facial emotions; and (3) a ‘bottom-up’ approach on identifying ASC/typical development (TD) differences, from a screening serious game context. Thirteen HF, kindergarten-age children with ASC and 13 children with TD, matched along age and IQ, participated. Emotion recognition was administered on video-recordings from sessions of their playing with the serious game. Results showed lack of inter-rater reliability in human coding, confirming some advantages of machine coding. The simple bottom-up cross-sectional exploratory analysis did not reveal any ASC/TD difference. This is in contrast with our and others’ previous results, indicating such differences when aggregating emotion data from wider time-windows in machine-coded data-sets. This suggests that this second approach may be a more promising one to identify autism-specific emotion expression patterns. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Conference paper</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1007/978-3-319-94277-3_72</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049778215&amp;doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-94277-3_72&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c153535257f14301cb903d0621501156</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism spectrum conditions; Emotional facial expressions; Screening; Serious game</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Automation; Behavioral research; Case based reasoning; Diseases; Screening; Serious games; Video recording; Autism spectrum conditions; Automated recognition; Children with autisms; Emotion recognition; Exploratory analysis; Facial expression recognition; Facial Expressions; Inter-rater reliabilities; Face recognition</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Springer Verlag</div></td><td class="s4">03029743</td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Cited by: 2; Conference name: 16th International Conference on Computers Helping People with Special Needs, ICCHP 2018; Conference date: 11 July 2018 through 13 July 2018; Conference code: 215549</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s9">45527,58032</td><td class="s9">45527,5806</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R15" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">16</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">15</td><td class="s3">Transactional relationships between maternal requesting and responsivity, adolescent compliance, and task demands in fragile X syndrome</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Fielding-Gebhardt, Heather and Brady, Nancy and Bredin-Oja, Shelley L. and Warren, Steven F.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Research in Developmental Disabilities</div></td><td class="s4">2023</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4">134</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Background: Males with fragile X syndrome (FXS) may have difficulty with social communication and language in addition to behavioral concerns such as noncompliance to maternal requests. Mothers vary in how they pose requests to their children, and contextual demands may also be a factor in compliance. This study examined the relationships between maternal requesting behaviors, maternal responsivity, child compliance, and task demands in adolescent males with FXS. Methods: 35 mother-son dyads completed three interactive tasks during in-home visits (puzzle, iPad games, snack). The adolescents also completed assessments of language and autism symptoms. The three interactive tasks were video-recorded, and behavior-by-behavior coding and transcription was completed. Results: Comparing between tasks, mothers requested a behavior most often during the snack task and used a higher proportion of indirect requests during the iPad task. Adolescents were largely compliant across tasks, with average compliance equal to 70%. Adolescent compliance was predicted by maternal request frequency such that mothers who used more requests had adolescent sons who were less compliant. Maternal responsivity was higher for mothers of adolescents with FXS-only compared to those with FXS and high autism symptoms. Conclusions and implications: Task demands may have influenced maternal requesting, which in turn may have impacted adolescent compliance. Compliance with requests is important for both social and educational aspects of life, and further study of requesting and compliance in FXS is needed to identify effective teaching and behavioral intervention methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1016/j.ridd.2022.104417</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146722176&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.ridd.2022.104417&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e8636d65fa7157f517354d2d9ca323de</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Fragile X syndrome; Indirect requests; Maternal responsivity; Mother-child interaction; Noncompliance</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Adolescent; Child; Communication; Female; Fragile X Syndrome; Humans; Male; Maternal Behavior; Mothers; Problem Behavior; fragile X mental retardation protein; adolescent; adolescent compliance; adult; Article; autism; Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule; Childhood Autism Rating Scale; cognition; compliance (physical); female; fragile X syndrome; human; impulsiveness; indirect request; interview; male; maternal responsivity; middle aged; mother child relation; predictor variable; psychoanalys</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Elsevier Inc.</div></td><td class="s4">08914222</td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Cited by: 1; All Open Access, Bronze Open Access</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s9">45527,58032</td><td class="s9">45527,58091</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R16" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">17</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">16</td><td class="s3">Personalized Training via Serious Game to Improve Daily Living Skills in Pediatric Patients With Autism Spectrum Disorder</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Vallefuoco, Ersilia and Bravaccio, Carmela and Gison, Giovanna and Pecchia, Leandro and Pepino, Alessandro</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics</div></td><td class="s4">2022</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">3312 – 3322</div></td><td class="s4">26</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">The majority of people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) exhibit difficulties in social communication and behavior, which hinder their learning capability, amid others. Among technological solutions for people with ASD, serious games are frequently used to enhance learning of specific skills and instructional contents. However, because of heterogeneity in applications and game design, few studies have investigated their use in training daily activities. This paper presents a 3D personalized serious game we developed and validated to help ASD patients practice with shopping activities. Personalized training is paramount in people with ASD, thus several elements of this game were personalized to improve engagement and therefore the effectiveness of the virtual training. In order to assess the validity of the game, ten subjects (age 11.9, 2.7&#39;, 20% female) with ASD played ten sessions of the serious game, once per week. The participants underwent a real-life experience pre- and post-training in a real-life supermarket. Changes in daily living skills among participants were evaluated through specific tools: a form based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth; and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II. Significant improvements (p &lt; 0.05) were detected in the main skills trained with the serious game, especially in learning the shopping procedure, directing attention, and problem-solving skills. These findings suggest that personalized serious games can represent a prominent tool to enhance daily living skills, but future work should clinically validate their efficacy. © 2013 IEEE.</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1109/JBHI.2022.3155367</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125734282&amp;doi=10.1109%2fJBHI.2022.3155367&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2ab1d90ea4725f963b57e6e6aecc8536</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism spectrum disorder; daily living skills; human-computer interactions; Serious games</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Adolescent; Attention; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Communication; Female; Humans; Male; Diagnosis; Diseases; Job analysis; Medical imaging; Pediatrics; Problem solving; Serious games; Autism spectrum disorders; Daily living; Daily living skill; Game; Medical diagnostic imaging; Pediatric patients; Social behaviour; Social communications; Task analysis; Variable-speed drives; adolescent; Article; attention; autism; autism diagnostic observation schedule second edition; behavior; bioinformati</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</div></td><td class="s4">21682194</td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Cited by: 13; All Open Access, Green Open Access, Hybrid Gold Open Access</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s9">45527,58032</td><td class="s9">45527,58079</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R17" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">18</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">17</td><td class="s3">An Android-Based Pre-Coding Method for Social Story Therapy Game Application for Children with Autism</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Atika, Syarifah and Aulia, Indra and Syahputra, Mohammad Fadly</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">2023 10th International Conference on Advanced Informatics: Concept, Theory and Application, ICAICTA 2023</div></td><td class="s4">2023</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism Spectrum Disorder cannot be cured, but therapy can reduce the symptoms of this disorder. One of the therapies offered is social story therapy, which utilizes a visual interactive approach in which a social story, or a written narrative, is read to the children by the therapist. The purpose of the story is to assist children in comprehending specific situations or conditions they encounter. The social story game will be developed in a 2D format. The social story that will be incorporated into the game focuses on the experiences of elementary school students in their daily lives. As part of the social story game, the precoding method will be incorporated, which is specifically designed to help children with autism improve their motor skills. Using drag-and-drop playstyles, this precoding technique will be implemented in mobile games. For the game development, we will be using Unity 3D, ensuring compatibility with the Android operating system. The game was tested with observation and usability testing. Observation result indicate that the children are showing interest in learning and playing the game. For the The Usability testing results indicate a 61.35% learnability function, 62% memorability function, 72% efficiency function, and 75% satisfaction function. These metrics were used to evaluate the game&#39;s performance and user satisfaction.  © 2023 IEEE.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Conference paper</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1109/ICAICTA59291.2023.10390505</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184661987&amp;doi=10.1109%2fICAICTA59291.2023.10390505&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f5357939c37a3e0bb58f7a0b45a622b6</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism Spectrum Disorder; Precoding; Social Story; Unity 3D</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Diseases; Software design; Autism spectrum disorders; Children with autisms; Coding methods; Condition; Elementary schools; Interactive approach; Precoding; Social story; Unity 3d; Usability testing; Android (operating system)</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Cited by: 0; Conference name: 10th International Conference on Advanced Informatics: Concept, Theory and Application, ICAICTA 2023; Conference date: 7 October 2023 through 9 October 2023; Conference code: 196771</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s9">45527,58032</td><td class="s9">45527,58047</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R18" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">19</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">18</td><td class="s3">&quot;Can You Help Me?&quot; An Experience Report of Teamwork in a Game Coding Camp for Autistic High School Students</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Moster, Makayla and Kokinda, Ella and Re, Matthew and Dominic, James and Lehmann, Jason and Begel, Andrew and Rodeghero, Paige</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering</div></td><td class="s4">2022</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4">50 – 61</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Teamwork skills are increasingly important for students to have as they enter the workforce, especially in software development positions.

The hybrid mode of education comes with challenges, including communication and collaboration issues and teaming difficulties, however, this method of teaching and learning can be difficult for students with autism. In this experience report paper, we discuss our experience planning and running a hybrid camp to teach teamwork and programming to 14 autistic high school students.

From its inception, autistic college<br>students have been involved in an iterative process to design, evaluate,<br>and redesign the game. The emotion recognition game has two playing<br>phases. In the first phase, the players independently assemble pieces in<br>a digital puzzle. In the second phase, players communicate in-person to<br>agree on the appropriate emotion for the context and construct the<br>emotional face for the body they have assembled together. We also<br>designed collaborative reward games that require the two players to<br>cooperate and one that encourages players to look at each other. In<br>order to assess the level of in-game cooperation, we added a face<br>tracking component that automatically quantifies collaboration and can<br>replace time-consuming hand-coded evaluations. We report on how this<br>game was designed and built by a team of autistic students, their peer<br>mentors, a psychologist, computer scientists, and a graphic artist.<br>Preliminary observations show that modeling of emotion recognition and<br>collaboration by peers with stronger social skills is emerging as a<br>central aspect of the effectiveness of our game. The participatory<br>process has led to several design changes including one that<br>dramatically increased player collaboration.

We collect gaze data<br>from two different kinds of tasks related to processing of information<br>from web pages: Browsing and Searching. The gaze data is then used to<br>train a machine learning classifier whose aim is to distinguish between<br>participants with autism and a control group of participants without<br>autism. In addition, we explore the effects of the type of the task<br>performed, different approaches to defining the areas of interest,<br>gender, visual complexity of the web pages and whether or not an area of<br>interest contained the correct answer to a searching task.

Prior<br>research indicates that Augmented Reality (AR) games appeal to children<br>with ASD for learning social skills but lack a structured framework and<br>clear instructions for grasping social concepts. Therefore, this<br>research aims to develop AR game content with a social story context and<br>computational thinking specifically tailored for specific social<br>situations. The goal is to assist children with ASD in mastering the<br>developmental context and social structure of complex social situations<br>through sequential and staged game activities. This helps children with<br>ASD develop social skills and reciprocal behaviors. Four<br>high-functioning children with ASD, aged 6 -9, participated in the<br>experiment. Their behavioral performance during game interactions,<br>learning, and social task accomplishments was observed using a<br>multiple-baseline design across subjects. After three stages of testing<br>and assessments, the results showed that incorporating AR effectively<br>piqued the interest of children with ASD in learning. In particular,<br>combining social stories and computational thinking game elements as<br>instructional strategies helped children with ASD understand social<br>tasks and contextual sequences. These intervention strategies also<br>indirectly manifested in changes in their behavioral abilities and<br>improvements in social reciprocity skills.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Article; Early Access</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">10.1080/10494820.2023.2258942</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Lee, IJ (Corresponding Author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Ind Design, Ergon Design \&amp; Technol Lab, Taipei, Taiwan.<br>Lee, I-Jui; Hsu, Hsiu-Ting, Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Ind Design, Ergon Design \&amp; Technol Lab, Taipei, Taiwan.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Augmented reality; autism; computational thinking; social stories;<br>social reciprocity</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \&amp; FRANCIS LTD</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">1049-4820</div></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s9">45525,73089</td><td class="s9">45525,73108</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R24" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">25</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">24</td><td class="s3">Tracking Representational Flexibility Development through Speech Data<br>Mining</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Ke, Fengfeng and Moon, Jewoong and Sokolikj, Zlatko</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2020</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:122px;left:-1px">Web of Science</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">In this work-in-progress research we exploited and investigated a<br>virtual reality (VR) based, flexibility learning environment (FLE) in<br>which adolescents with autism use, customize, and design an assortment<br>of simulation games that represent and exemplify the application of<br>forces and Newton&#39;s laws of motion.

Among technological solutions for<br>people with ASD, serious games are frequently used to enhance learning<br>of specific skills and instructional contents. However, because of<br>heterogeneity in applications and game design, few studies have<br>investigated their use in training daily activities. This paper presents<br>a 3D personalized serious game we developed and validated to help ASD<br>patients practice with shopping activities. Personalized training is<br>paramount in people with ASD, thus several elements of this game were<br>personalized to improve engagement and therefore the effectiveness of<br>the virtual training. In order to assess the validity of the game, ten<br>subjects (age 11.9 +/- 2.7, 20\% female) with ASD played ten sessions of<br>the serious game, once per week. The participants underwent a real-life<br>experience pre- and post-training in a real-life supermarket. Changes in<br>daily living skills among participants were evaluated through specific<br>tools: a form based on the International Classification of Functioning,<br>Disability and Health for Children and Youth; and the Vineland Adaptive<br>Behavior Scale II. Significant improvements (p&lt;0.05) were detected in<br>the main skills trained with the serious game, especially in learning<br>the shopping procedure, directing attention, and problem-solving skills.<br>These findings suggest that personalized serious games can represent a<br>prominent tool to enhance daily living skills, but future work should<br>clinically validate their efficacy.</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">10.1109/JBHI.2022.3155367</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Vallefuoco, E (Corresponding Author), Univ Naples Federico II, SInAPSi Ctr, I-80126 Naples, Italy.<br>Vallefuoco, Ersilia, Univ Naples Federico II, SInAPSi Ctr, I-80126 Naples, Italy.<br>Bravaccio, Carmela, Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Translat Med Sci, I-80131 Naples, Italy.<br>Gison, Giovanna, Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Mental Phys Hlth \&amp; Prevent Med, I-80138 Naples, Italy.<br>Pecchia, Leandro, Univ Warwick, Sch Engn, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.<br>Pepino, Alessandro, Univ Naples Feder</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Serious games; Autism spectrum disorder; daily living skills;<br>human-computer interactions</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">2168-2194</div></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s9">45525,73089</td><td class="s9">45525,73159</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:67px;left:-1px">Duplicated</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="1340451548R28" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">29</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">28</td><td class="s3">Developing Computational Thinking for Children with Autism using a<br>Serious Game</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Elshahawy, Menna and Bakhaty, Mariam and Sharaf, Nada</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2020</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Web of Science</div></td><td class="s4">761-766</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of life-long conditions<br>that are characterized by qualitative impairments in social<br>interactions, problem solving and constructive skills.
