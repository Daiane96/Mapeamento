better represented in<br>design solutions. Autistic children are often marginalised and excluded<br>from design processes due to concerns about how their social and<br>communication differences may act as barriers to participation, leading<br>to calls for design processes to be more inclusive and examined more<br>closely to understand the value of participation for (autistic) children<br>and young people. This research describes a participatory design project<br>to develop a computer game during a weekly coding club at a special<br>school. Fourteen autistic (neurodivergent) young people, eight staff<br>members, four technology industry representatives and a Doctoral<br>researcher worked together to design, develop, test, and evaluate the<br>game. This article focuses specifically on the views and experiences of<br>two of the students, which are captured primarily through a Digital<br>Story. Digital Stories are short student-centred videos which show<br>educational experiences. We use a social semiotic multimodal approach to<br>analysis which does not prioritise linguistically encoded meaning,<br>instead recognising the importance and validity of the many and varied<br>ways in which students contributed to the project. The findings<br>highlight the valuable opportunities that participatory design processes<br>can provide for students as both learners and as expert knowers. It<br>emphasises the need to allow room for students&#39; agency in the design<br>process, so that they really can have a say in the outcomes of design<br>and feel ownership over the process and outcomes of their research<br>participation.</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">10.3389/feduc.2022.864362</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Ward, V (Corresponding Author), Univ Southampton, Southampton Educ Sch, Southampton, Hants, England.Ward, V (Corresponding Author), Autism Community Res Network Southampton ACoRNS, Southampton, Hants, England.Ward, Verity; Parsons, Sarah, Univ Southampton, Southampton Educ Sch, Southampton, Hants, England.Ward, Verity; Parsons, Sarah; Kovshoff, Hanna, Autism Community Res Network Southampton ACoRNS, Southampton, Hants, England.Kovshoff, Hanna, Univ Southampton, Sch Psychol, Southampton, Hant</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">participatory design; co-creation; strengths-based; autism;neurodiversity; multimodality</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">FRONTIERS MEDIA SA</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,73089</td><td class="s7">45600,86891</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R2" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">3</div></th><td class="s7">2</td><td class="s3">Autistic youth in 3D game-based collaborative virtual learning:Associating avatar interaction patterns with embodied social presence</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Wang, Xianhui and Xing, Wanli and Laffey, James M.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY</div></td><td class="s4">2018</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Web of Science</div></td><td class="s4">742-760</td><td class="s4">49</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">This study examines interaction patterns in a series of game activities<br>for learning social skills by autistic youth in a 3D game-based<br>collaborative virtual learning environment (CVLE). Researchers studying<br>collaborative learning have indicated the importance of social<br>interactions and social presence. However, few studies have examined the<br>relationship of avatar social interactions with embodied social presence<br>in a 3D game-based CVLE. Specifically, we examined avatar-mediated<br>verbal and nonverbal interactions by autistic youth in iSocial, a<br>game-based 3D CVLE for developing social competencies. How are<br>avatar-mediated verbal and nonverbal social interactions related to the<br>extent of embodied social presence? Building on prior studies on<br>embodied social presence (ESP) theory and the verbal and nonverbal<br>social interaction framework, this paper aims to explore the link<br>between the combination of verbal (appropriate and inappropriate) and<br>nonverbal (avatar proximity, orientation, joint attention and gesture)<br>interaction patterns and experienced ESP level. We report on the results<br>of 3 cohorts of a total of 11 youth aged from 11 to 14 who were<br>diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder learning in 13 game activities<br>in iSocial. The video data of the participants&#39; screen recordings were<br>analyzed and coded based on the ESP theory and verbal and nonverbal<br>social interaction framework. Through cluster analysis, the results<br>identify distinct patterns of verbal and nonverbal interaction that are<br>associated with different levels of embodied social presence. The<br>findings of this study (1) shed light on the link between social<br>interactions and embodied social presence and (2) provide a deeper<br>understanding of how the unique spatial and visual characteristics of 3D<br>CVLE and the design of game activities in 3D CVLE may transform<br>collaborative learning, especially for autistic youth.</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">10.1111/bjet.12646</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:183px;left:-1px">Wang, XH (Corresponding Author), Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Journalism \&amp; Commun, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.Wang, Xianhui, Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Journalism \&amp; Commun, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.Xing, Wanli, Texas Tech Univ, Instruct Technol, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.Laffey, James M., Univ Missouri, Sch Informat Sci \&amp; Learning Technol, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.Laffey, James M., Apple Comp Inc, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA.</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">WILEY</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">0007-1013</div></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,73089</td><td class="s7">45600,00285</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R3" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">4</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">3</td><td class="s3">Supporting Youth With Autism Learning Social Competence: A Comparison ofGame- and Nongame-Based Activities in 3D Virtual World</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Wang, Xianhui and Xing, Wanli</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH</div></td><td class="s4">2022</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Web of Science</div></td><td class="s4">74-103</td><td class="s4">60</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">This study explored youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) learning<br>social competence in the context of innovative 3D virtual learning<br>environment and the effects of gaming as a central element of the<br>learning experience. The empirical study retrospectively compared the<br>social interactions of 11 adolescents with ASD in game-and nongame-based<br>3D collaborative learning activities in the same social competence<br>training curriculum. We employed a learning analytics approach -<br>association rule mining to uncover the associative rules of verbal<br>social interaction and nonverbal social interaction contributors from<br>the large dataset of the coded social behaviors. By comparing the rules<br>across the game and nongame activities, we found a significant<br>difference in youth with ASD&#39;s social performance. The results of the<br>group comparison study indicated that the co-occurrence of verbal and<br>nonverbal behaviors is much stronger in the game-based learning<br>activities. The game activities also yielded more diverse social<br>interaction behavior patterns. On the other hand, in the nongame<br>activities, students&#39; social interaction behavior patterns are much more<br>limited. Furthermore, the impact of game design principles on learning<br>is then discussed in this paper.</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">10.1177/07356331211022003</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Xing, WL (Corresponding Author), Univ Florida, Sch Teaching \&amp; Learning, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.Wang, Xianhui, Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Journalism \&amp; Commun, Wuhan, Peoples R China.Xing, Wanli, Univ Florida, Sch Teaching \&amp; Learning, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">game-based learning; collaborative game in 3D virtual environment;social interaction; association rule mining; autism spectrum disorder</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">0735-6331</div></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,73089</td><td class="s7">45599,98939</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R4" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">5</div></th><td class="s7">4</td><td class="s3">Tracking Representational Flexibility Development through Speech Data Mining</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Ke, Fengfeng and Moon, Jewoong and Sokolikj, Zlatko</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2020</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s4">1-4</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">In this work-in-progress research we exploited and investigated a virtual reality (VR) based, flexibility learning environment (FLE) in which adolescents with autism use, customize, and design an assortment of simulation games that represent and exemplify the application of forces and Newton&#39;s laws of motion.

A SAR called EVA (Embodied Voice Assistant) is an open-source robotics platform intended to serve as a tool to support research in Human-Robot Interaction. The EVA robot was originally developed to assist in non-pharmacological interventions for people with Dementia and has more recently been applied for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. EVA provides multimodal interactions such as verbal and non-verbal communication, facial recognition and light sensory effects. Although EVA uses low-cost hardware and open-source software, it is not always possible, or practical, to have a physical robot at hand, particularly during rapid iterative cycles of design and evaluation of therapies. Thus, our motivation to develop a simulator that allows testing the scripts of therapies to be enacted by the EVA robot. This work proposes EvaSIM (EVA Robot Simulator), a simulator that can interpret an EVA script code and emulate the multimodal interaction capabilities of the physical robot, such as Text-To-Speech, facial expression recognition, controlling light sensory effects, etc. Several EVA scripts were run using the simulator attesting that they have the same behaviour as the physical robot. EvaSIM can serve as a support tool in the teaching/learning process of the robot’s scripting language, enabling the training of technicians and therapists in script development and testing for the EVA robot.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:246px;left:-1px">10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900561</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s8 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Autism;Visualization;Face recognition;Medical treatment;XML;Transforms;Robot sensing systems</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:122px;left:-1px">1944-9437</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,65922</td><td class="s7">45593,79389</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R6" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">7</div></th><td class="s7">6</td><td class="s3">&quot;Can You Help Me?&quot; An Experience Report of Teamwork in a Game Coding Camp for Autistic High School Students</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Moster, Makayla and Kokinda, Ella and Re, Matthew and Dominic, James and Lehmann, Jason and Begel, Andrew and Rodeghero, Paige</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2022</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s4">50-61</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Teamwork skills are increasingly important for students to have as they enter the workforce, especially in software development positions. However, autistic students do not get to practice teamwork since much of their education is focused on learning social skills. The hybrid mode of education comes with challenges, including communication and collaboration issues and teaming difficulties, however, this method of teaching and learning can be difficult for students with autism. In this experience report paper, we discuss our experience planning and running a hybrid camp to teach teamwork and programming to 14 autistic high school students. Overall, our camp was successful in teaching students software development skills with open source software, and, from our experience, we detail our lessons learned and provide recommendations for educators and researchers working with autistic students in a hybrid setting.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:184px;left:-1px">10.1145/3510456.3514154</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:307px;left:-1px">Training;Human computer interaction;Electric breakdown;Games;Encoding;Teamwork;Planning;Human-centered computing → Accessibility;Collaborative and social computing;Social and professional topics → Computing education</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,65922</td><td class="s7">45593,78176</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R7" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">8</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">7</td><td class="s3">Design of an interactive system of tangible interfaces to support learning in children with autism</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Carreño-León, Mónica A. and Andrés Sandoval-Bringas, J. and Encinas, Israel Durán and Cosio Castro, Rafael and Cota, Italia Estrada and Leyva Carrillo, Alejandro</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2020</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s4">15-19</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Children with autistic spectrum conditions are characterized by presenting a wide spectrum of serious limitations in several fundamental aspects of development: impaired social interactions and communication, and the presence of repetitive and restrictive patterns of interest and behavior. The different areas of science and technology have shown an interest in caring for people with special needs. In this research, the construction of a technological prototype is presented as a complement to the development of skills for learning in children on the autism spectrum. The technological prototype considers the incorporation of tangible objects that are recognized by gamified software applications. The proposed user interface is an object identifier board with RFID code, as well as a set of objects and / or cards that are recognized by the application. The prototype was first evaluated by experts in the area of special education and secondly by a user with characteristics of the autism spectrum. In both cases, the results obtained are considered favorable.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:246px;left:-1px">10.1109/CONTIE51334.2020.00012</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s8 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:307px;left:-1px">Autism;Visualization;Technological innovation;Education;Prototypes;User interfaces;Tools;Inclusion;Autism;TUI;Learning process;gamification</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,65922</td><td class="s7">45589,87784</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R8" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">9</div></th><td class="s7">8</td><td class="s3">EnCity: A serious game for empowering young people with Down&#39;s syndrome</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Bourazeri, Aikaterini and Bellamy-Wood, Tyrone and Arnab, Sylvester</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2017</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s4">1-6</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Down&#39;s syndrome (also known as trisomy 21) is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of a third copy of chromosome 21 in a baby&#39;s cell.

In this paper, we present an alternative way for detecting the condition based on the atypical visual-attention patterns of people with autism. We collect gaze data from two different kinds of tasks related to processing of information from web pages: Browsing and Searching. The gaze data is then used to train a machine learning classifier whose aim is to distinguish between participants with autism and a control group of participants without autism. In addition, we explore the effects of the type of the task performed, different approaches to defining the areas of interest, gender, visual complexity of the web pages and whether or not an area of interest contained the correct answer to a searching task. Our best-performing classifier achieved 0.75 classification accuracy for a combination of selected web pages using all gaze features. These preliminary results show that the differences in the way people with autism process web content could be used for the future development of serious games for autism screening.

Numerous studies have reported the positive impact of serious games on the learning process for individuals with autism. However, many of these games do not utilize techniques known to be effective when teaching this specific audience, such as those based on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). ABA is a behavioral science approach that employs error-free, intensive, and individualized teaching methods, with the goal of promoting independence in the individual. Therefore, this article focuses on incorporating ABA elements into serious games for this target audience, by introducing a Game Design Document (GDD) model that encompasses a set of learning characteristics based on ABA principles. The aim is to provide guidance to designers take these characteristics into consideration in the development of serious games. To validate the model, we conducted two surveys: one involving 15 ABA therapists to validate the ABA characteristics, and another involving 18 game developers to validate the information and organization of the GDD itself. The evaluation results demonstrate that the created model contains information consistent with ABA therapeutic interventions and that it offers valuable insights for serious game designers. Additionally, the GDD model provides characteristics that enable quantitative analysis of learning outcomes.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:246px;left:-1px">10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3289857</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s8 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Games;Behavioral sciences;Education;Autism;Serious games;Guidelines;Serious game;game design document;autism;applied behavior analysis;education</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:122px;left:-1px">2169-3536</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,65922</td><td class="s7">45681,93656</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R11" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">12</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">11</td><td class="s3">Determining child orientation from overhead video: A multiple kernel learning approach</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Manner, Marie D. and Jiang, Ming and Zhao, Qi and Gini, Maria and Elison, Jed</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2017</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:122px;left:-1px">3477-3482</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s8 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Our goal is to automatically detect which direction a child is facing based on a single, simple overhead picture, and track that direction across time. Engaging in joint attention, which is the shared focus of two individuals on some object of interest, is a strong cue of typically developing children, and the lack thereof can be an indicator of autism spectrum disorder or other pervasive developmental disorder. Therefore, the goal of many psychology experiments with children is to determine when, for how long, and towards what the child looks after some bid for attention or reaction. While much research looks for the orientation of faces based on frontal or profile pictures, or non-morphable, larger objects like cars, fewer studies work in the setting of minimally-invasive overhead person gaze or orientation detection. To automatically detect the child&#39;s orientation during a human-robot interaction experiment, we mount a camera on the ceiling of a child development laboratory and analyze the video footage. We use multiple kernel learning on eight potential orientation directions to determine a child&#39;s orientation during the video recorded interaction. We also contribute the labelled dataset we used on this challenging problem.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:184px;left:-1px">10.1109/SMC.2017.8123169</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:307px;left:-1px">Cameras;Robots;Autism;Sensors;Tracking;Games;Head</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,65922</td><td class="s7">45586,75277</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R12" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">13</div></th><td class="s7">12</td><td class="s3">Mirroring and recognizing emotions through facial expressions for a RoboKind platform</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Silva, Vinícius and Soares, Filomena and Sena Esteves, João</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2017</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s4">1-4</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">The face embodies a large portion of the human emotionally expressive behaviour.

Although the process of recognition and displaying emotions is an easy task for the majority of humans, it is a very difficult task for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The present paper is a summary of a work developed under a Master Thesis on Industrial Electronics Engineering and Computers from the University of Minho, Portugal. The main goal of the work was the development and application of interactive and assistive technologies to support and promote new adaptive teaching/learning approaches for children with ASD. Therefore, it was proposed a system that uses the recent Intel RealSense 3D sensor to promote imitation and recognition of facial expressions, using a RoboKind Zeno R50 robot (ZECA) as a mediator in social activities. The system was first validated in the research laboratory and then tested in school environment with typically developing children and children with ASD.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:246px;left:-1px">10.1109/ENBENG.2017.7889480</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s8 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:307px;left:-1px">Robot sensing systems;Face;Erbium;Face recognition;Support vector machines;Emotion recognition</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,65922</td><td class="s7">45593,79918</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R13" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">14</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">13</td><td class="s3">``We&#39;ve got a few who don&#39;t go to PE&#39;: Learning support assistant andspecial educational needs coordinator views on inclusion in physicaleducation in England</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Maher, Anthony John</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">EUROPEAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW</div></td><td class="s4">2017</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Web of Science</div></td><td class="s4">257-270</td><td class="s4">23</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Britain&#39;s 1981 Education Act stimulated a partial migration of pupils<br>from special to mainstream schools. The onus has since been on teachers<br>to meet the needs and capitalise on the capabilities of pupils with<br>special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in mainstream school<br>settings. The research analysed learning support assistant (LSA) and<br>special educational needs coordinator (SENCO) views on inclusion in<br>physical education (PE). Individual interviews were conducted with 12<br>LSAs and 12 SENCOs working in mainstream schools in North-West England.<br>Open, axial and selective coding was performed on interview transcripts<br>to identify reoccurring themes. The research found that SENCOs and LSAs<br>considered PE to be an inclusive subject, the conceptualisation of which<br>was left to them. However, developing PE provision that met the needs<br>and optimised the capabilities of pupils with autism spectrum disorders<br>(ASD), and supporting pupils with SEND during team games and competitive<br>sports, were identified as key challenges to inclusion in PE. This may<br>be of concern to some educationalists given that these types of<br>curriculum activities have recently been repositioned at the heart of PE<br>in England. A key challenge for all those involved in educating pupils<br>with SEND in PE, especially teachers and LSAs, is to plan and teach team<br>games and competitive sports in ways that meet the needs of and stretch<br>all pupils, in particular those with ASD.</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">10.1177/1356336X16649938</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Maher, AJ (Corresponding Author), Leeds Beckett Univ, Sch Sport, Carnegie Fac, Headingley Campus, Leeds LS6 3QH, W Yorkshire, England.Maher, Anthony John, Leeds Beckett Univ, Sch Sport, Carnegie Fac, Headingley Campus, Leeds LS6 3QH, W Yorkshire, England.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Disability; learning support assistants; physical education; specialeducational needs; special educational needs coordinators</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">1356-336X</div></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,73089</td><td class="s7">45586,74914</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R14" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">15</div></th><td class="s7">14</td><td class="s3">Animating DGBL in Pre-School, Primary and Special Education: Three CaseStudies</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Florou, Dimitra and Mavroudi, Charalambia and Haidi, Irini and Gouscos,Dimitris and Meimaris, Michael</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2009</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Web of Science</div></td><td class="s4">124-134</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">This paper reports on three digital GBL pilots which have taken place,<br>respectively, in pre-school, primary school and special education<br>settings, for project assignments of the ``ICT in Education{&#39;&#39;} MSc<br>program jointly run by the University of Athens, the University of<br>Thessaly and the Technological Educational Institute of Piraeus, Greece.<br>The pilots reported have involved 9 educators and 44 students in total<br>and have been based on freeware micro-games, some new games developed<br>from scratch as well as the ``Magic Potion{&#39;&#39;} digital adventure tale<br>developed by the University of Athens Laboratory of New Technologies in<br>Communication, Education and the Mass Media within the EPINOISI project.<br>Interventions have focused on animating the application of DGBL material<br>in class and effectively documenting student reactions and attitudes.<br>Conclusions have been drawn on the learning potential of successfully<br>animated DGBL interventions and on the expectations of young learners<br>towards the games employed. The first pilot concerns a pre-school<br>intervention for learning basic math concepts. Four sessions have been<br>organised with the participation of 10 pre-school students, using<br>freeware micro-games from the Up To Ten and Poisson Rouge web sites and<br>the Minisebran suite, as well as a simple Flash game designed ad hoc. A<br>prototype code of conduct during gameplay has been put in place and a<br>number of conclusions have been drawn by observing and evaluating<br>student reactions and opinions, expressed by the students through<br>drawing and talking about their likes and dislikes. The second pilot has<br>involved application of DGBL material on linguistic topics, in order to<br>investigate whether digital games can enhance the<br>functional-communicational perspective of language. The intervention<br>involved two primary schools with a group of 15 students each, and<br>observation/discussion were employed for evaluating results. Conditions<br>of communication were created in which the students used the language,<br>collaborated to seek clues and information, formulated and evaluated<br>hypotheses and expressed opinions. During the last part of the pilot<br>each student group was asked to describe a language game that would<br>serve as a challenge for the other group, and two such prototype games<br>were developed in Flash. This activity gave the students the opportunity<br>to express themselves and apply their knowledge on structure and use of<br>written language, while at the same time providing a frame of<br>communication and ``competition{&#39;&#39;} between the two schools. The third<br>intervention focused on DGBL material for children with autism disorders<br>(AD). Four children with AD were given access to DGBL material in order<br>to investigate the potential of digital games to activate their<br>attention, bring a playful character to the learning process and make<br>more amusing the achievement of objectives. The material employed<br>includes online freeware games and commercial edutainment software, as<br>well as parts of the ``Magic Potion{&#39;&#39;} digital adventure tale, whereas<br>the educators created an additional Flash game for social/emotional<br>skills.

Head pose (yaw, pitch, and roll) is also detected using an algorithm presented at this conference (Whitehill &amp; Movellan, 2008). A sample output is shown in Figure 1. This system was employed in some of the earliest experiments in which spontaneous behavior was analyzed with automated expression recognition to extract new information about facial expression that was previously unknown (Bartlett et al., 2008). These experiments addressed automated discrimination of posed from genuine expressions of pain, and automated detection of driver drowsiness. The analysis revealed information about facial behavior during these conditions that were previously unknown, including the coupling of movements. Automated classifiers were able to differentiate real from fake pain significantly better than naïve human subjects, and to detect driver drowsiness above 98% accuracy. Another experiment showed that facial expression was able to predict perceived difficulty of a video lecture and preferred presentation speed (Whitehill et al., 2008). CERT is also being employed in a project to give feedback on facial expression production to children with autism. A prototype game, called SmileMaze, requires the player to produce a smile to enable a character to pass though doors and obtain rewards (Tanaka et al., 2008). Statistical pattern recognition on large quantities of video data can reveal emergent behavioral patterns that previously would have required hundreds of coding hours by human experts, and would be unattainable by the nonexpert. Moreover, automated facial expression analysis will enable investigations into facial expression dynamics that were previously intractable by human coding because of the time required to code intensity changes. The technical approach to CERT is a texture-based discriminative approach. Such approaches have proven highly robust and fast for face detection and tracking (e.g. Viola &amp; Jones, 2001). Face and detection and detection of internal facial features is first performed on each frame using boosting techniques in a generative framework (Fasel et al.) extending work by Viola and Jones (2001). Enhancements to Viola and Jones include employing Gentleboost instead of AdaBoost, smart feature search, and a novel cascade training procedure, combined in a generative framework. The automatically located faces are then rescaled to 96×96 pixels. The typical distance between the centers of the eyes is roughly 48 pixels. Faces are then aligned using a fast least squares fit on the detected features, and then passed through a bank of Gabor filters 8 orientations and 9 spatial frequencies (2:32 pixels per cycle at 1/2 octave steps). Output magnitudes were then normalized and passed to the facial action classifiers. Facial action detectors were then developed by training separate support vector machines to detect the presence or absence of each facial action. The training set consisted of over 8000 images from both posed and spontaneous expressions, which were coded for facial actions from the Facial Action Coding System. The datasets were the Cohn-Kanade DFAT-504 dataset (Kanade, Cohn &amp; Tian, 2000); The Ekman, Hager dataset of directed facial actions (Bartlett et al., 1999); A subset of 50 videos from 20 subjects from the MMI database (Pantic et al., 2005); and three spontaneous expression datasets collected by Mark Frank D005, D006, D007 (Bartlett et. al. 2006). Performances on a benchmark datasets (Cohn-Kanade) show state of the art performance for both recognition of basic emotions (98% correct detection for 1 vs all, and 93% correct for 7 alternative forced choice), and for recognizing facial actions</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Conference paper</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813406</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:183px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67650659359&amp;doi=10.1109%2fAFGR.2008.4813406&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=46e401761aae6b0eb8687e0691e13c69</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:183px;left:-1px">Adaptive boosting; Automation; Classifiers; Computer keyboards; Detectors; Experiments; Gesture recognition; Image coding; Learning systems; Pixels; Signal encoding; Video recording; AdaBoost; Alternative forced choice; Automated classifiers; Automated detection; Basic emotions; Behavioral patterns; Benchmark datasets; Children with autisms; Computer expressions; Data sets; Detection system; Discriminative approach; Driver drowsiness; Expression recognition; Face detection and tracking; Facial a</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Cited by: 55; Conference name: 2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, FG 2008; Conference date: 17 September 2008 through 19 September 2008; Conference code: 76409; All Open Access, Green Open Access</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45527,58032</td><td class="s7">45586,73701</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R16" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">17</div></th><td class="s7">16</td><td class="s3">People Skills of Behavior Analysts as Co-designers with Autistic Adults: Applied Behavior Analysis Integrated into Virtual Reality Game-Based Intervention Supports</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Rojas, Javier Alejandro</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">People Skills for Behavior Analysts</div></td><td class="s4">2023</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4">316 – 326</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">This chapter aims to illustrate with varied examples how behavior analysts may use people skills to support an active role of autistic adults in co-designing virtual reality game-based intervention programs. The autistic adults-centered design is presented as the core method to effectively integrate applied behavior analysis principles into technology-based support co-designed for in-game assessment and intervention. This method for co-designing technology-based supports may allow behavior analysts to develop people skills for scaffolding autistic adults’ preferences and choice-related skills. Problem-solving is people skills that behavior analysts may develop to effectively integrate antecedent-based strategies and consequence-based interventions to meet autistic adults’ needs for learning through technology-based supports. Behavior analysts may use problem-solving skills such as inspiration, imagination, and mind mapping to design choice opportunities that integrate antecedent-behavior-consequence strategies into virtual reality game-based learning. Designing these in-game choice opportunities may increase the engagement of autistic adults in learning and empower them throughout intervention programs by improving their decision-making skills. Behavior analysts also may develop communication, leadership and teamwork skills such as artistic sense, brainstorming, and experimentation to discover and craft with autistic adults the most engaging game mechanisms that motivate them to learn through virtual reality-game-based intervention programs. Finally, innovation and troubleshooting are essential people skills that behavior analysts may use to integrate practitioners’ decision-making models into evaluation functions programmed in the game architecture to identify, measure, evaluate, and intervene in target behaviors. In conclusion, the autistic adults-centered method to co-design virtual reality-game-based support for assessment and intervention programs provides innumerable learning opportunities for behavior analysts to develop practical people skills to perform active roles as technology-based support co-designers. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Carmen Hall, Kimberly Maich and Brianna M.

The study highlights the impact of social robots as ‘assistive tools’ for improving achievement in learning and providing enriched and engaged learning experiences to ASD individuals. Inspired by the simulation theory of cognition, the research attempts to address ethical-social robotics by adding an ethical layer to a humanoid NAO robot. We focus on developing a STEM-focused ‘robotic artificial intelligence (AI)’ social robotics course for ASD individuals encompassing social-behavioral and ethical elements of social cognition, ethics, and basic and advanced rules of human behavior and engagement in human–robot interaction scenarios. The research highlights curriculum design and instruction processes, followed by the educational analysis methodology and key findings, demonstrating the massive beneficial impact of social-ethical robotic autonomy on student performance that extends far beyond the boundaries of specific technical concepts taught in robotics and helps ASD individuals develop social-behavioral, ethical, and computational thinking skills.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1007/978-3-031-04867-8_3</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:245px;left:-1px">https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-04867-8_3</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Springer International Publishing</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">en</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45467,65933</td><td class="s7">45599,90692</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R21" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">22</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">21</td><td class="s3"> Jogos de tabuleiro como ferramentas para estímulo ao Pensamento Computacional em estudantes com TEA</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Vanessa Balbino and Alessandra Oliveira and Marcelo Chilingue and Ruth Braz and Sérgio Pinto</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2023</td><td class="s4">SOL</td><td class="s4">55--64</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Este artigo analisou como os jogos de tabuleiro podem estimular o Pensamento Computacional em estudantes com Transtorno do Espectro Autista.

Since children with the oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) often have problems in social skills, using video games designed to improve emotion regulation, has attracted many researchers treating other groups of children with special needs, since these games can be used with or without the therapist presence; and this would save money and energy. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of EmoGalaxy, a video game, designed to improve emotion regulation, on the social skills of elementary school girls with ODD. The effectiveness of this intervention was evaluated by quasi-experimental research with a pretest-posttest and a control group. 12 students in the experimental group participated in this program, and the control group did not receive any treatment and received the intervention after the experimental group intervention period. The instruments used in this study were the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI-4) and DSM-5 Checklist. Also, the teacher form of the Social Skills Rating Scale (Gresham and Elliott, 1990) was used to measure social skills. The obtained data were analyzed using Multiple Analysis of the Covariance (MANCOVA).

This is particularly evident in communications between a teacher and a pupil when facial expressions signal levels of understanding and enjoyment will change the teacher&#39;s explanation to a pupil, and effective e-learning systems must adapt in the same way if they are provide the social interactions that are necessary for effective pedagogy. Affective computing can equip computer systems with the ability to process social signals and respond accordingly. However, social signals are inherently ambiguous and confusion will result if the approach to processing them is too mechanistic. This paper presents and analyses empirical evidence for this ambiguity, and proposes a possible solution. The techniques are applicable in a wide variety of applications where continuous measures of performance are being assessed.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:246px;left:-1px">10.1109/CoDIT.2014.6996969</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s8 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:307px;left:-1px">Games;Electronic learning;Monitoring;Computational modeling;Computers;Standards;Adaptive systems;Affective computing;educational games;emotions;human-computer interaction;social signal processing</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,65922</td><td class="s7">45586,75469</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R24" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">25</div></th><td class="s7">24</td><td class="s3">Authic: Computational tool for children with autistic spectrum disorder</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Castillo, Tayde A. and de Celis, Concepción Pérez and Lara, Carmen and Somodevilla, María J. and Pineda, Ivo H. and de Alba, Karina F. and Romero, Erick</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2016</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s4">1-6</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">The AUTHIC project is part of assistive technologies and it aims to develop tools which aid children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to understand and interpret facial expressions associated with an emotion, through interactive games supervised by a therapist.

Several researchers have studied the ANS in ASD, during<br>specific cognitive or sensory stimuli while few studies have examined<br>response during social interactions. Wearable technologies can be very<br>helpful in monitoring autonomic response in children with ASD in<br>semi-naturalistic setting. The novelty of this study is to use such<br>technologies to acquire physiological signals during therapeutic<br>sessions supported by interactive ``serious games{&#39;&#39;} and to correlate<br>the ANS response to the engagement of the child during sociocognitive<br>tasks for an evaluation of the treatment effect and for the<br>personalization of the therapy.<br>Method: A wearable chest belt for electrocardiographic (ECG) signal<br>recording was used and specific algorithms for the extraction of<br>clinically relevant features (Heart Rate - HR, Root Mean Square of the<br>Successive Differences - RMSSD and Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia - RSA)<br>were developed. Sociocognitive tasks were mediated by ``serious<br>games{&#39;&#39;} implemented on two tablets, which allowed a precise coding of<br>the behaviors of the children. A longitudinal assessment of the<br>physiological response of the children during six months of treatment<br>was performed.<br>Results: A link between physiological response, i.e. decrease in RMSSD<br>and RSA, and engagement of the children during sociocognitive tasks was<br>found. Longitudinal changes in the children&#39;s autonomic response,<br>including a decrease of RSA during the engagement throughout the<br>therapeutic sessions, were found.<br>Conclusions: These results foster the feasibility of this methodology to<br>be applied in a clinical setting for the monitoring of the ANS response<br>of children with ASD during treatment. A larger sample of patients is<br>needed to confirm these preliminary findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Mothers vary in how they<br>pose requests to their children, and contextual demands may also be a<br>factor in compliance. This study examined the relationships between<br>maternal requesting be-haviors, maternal responsivity, child compliance,<br>and task demands in adolescent males with FXS.Methods: 35 mother-son<br>dyads completed three interactive tasks during in-home visits (puzzle,<br>iPad games, snack). The adolescents also completed assessments of<br>language and autism symp-toms. The three interactive tasks were<br>video-recorded, and behavior-by-behavior coding and transcription was<br>completed.Results: Comparing between tasks, mothers requested a behavior<br>most often during the snack task and used a higher proportion of<br>indirect requests during the iPad task. Adolescents were largely<br>compliant across tasks, with average compliance equal to 70\%.<br>Adolescent compliance was predicted by maternal request frequency such<br>that mothers who used more requests had adolescent sons who were less<br>compliant. Maternal responsivity was higher for mothers of ado-lescents<br>with FXS-only compared to those with FXS and high autism<br>symptoms.Conclusions and implications: Task demands may have influenced<br>maternal requesting, which in turn may have impacted adolescent<br>compliance. Compliance with requests is important for both social and<br>educational aspects of life, and further study of requesting and<br>compliance in FXS is needed to identify effective teaching and<br>behavioral intervention methods.</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">10.1016/j.ridd.2022.104417</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Fielding-Gebhardt, H (Corresponding Author), Univ Kansas, Schiefelbusch Inst Life Span Studies, 1000 Sunnyside Ave,DHDC 1050, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.Fielding-Gebhardt, Heather; Brady, Nancy; Warren, Steven F., Univ Kansas, Schiefelbusch Inst Life Span Studies, 1000 Sunnyside Ave,DHDC 1050, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.Brady, Nancy; Warren, Steven F., Univ Kansas, Dept Speech Language Hearing Sci \&amp; Disorders, 1000 Sunnyside Ave,DHDC 3001, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.Bredin-Oja, Shelley L., Minot State U</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Fragile X syndrome; Noncompliance; Mother -child interaction; Indirectrequests; Maternal responsivity</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">0891-4222</div></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,73089</td><td class="s7">45586,743</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R28" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">29</div></th><td class="s7">28</td><td class="s3">Stress and Coping in Autistic Young Adults</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Cheak-Zamora, Nancy and Odunleye, Olakunle</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">AUTISM IN ADULTHOOD</div></td><td class="s4">2022</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Web of Science</div></td><td class="s4">193-202</td><td class="s4">4</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Community brief Why is this an important issue?Few studies have examined<br>what autistic young adults go through as they move from childhood to<br>adulthood. Moving from high school to more adult duties is stressful for<br>all young adults. It is unclear how autistic young adults deal with<br>these changes. What was the purpose of this study?We wanted to better<br>understand the experiences, stressors, supports, and coping styles of<br>autistic young adults as they move from childhood to adulthood. What did<br>the researchers do?We asked autistic young adults to describe their<br>experiences, stressors, and how they cope as they age from teen years to<br>adulthood. Fifteen autistic young adults were interviewed through Google<br>Document or in-person interviews. To analyze the data, three researchers<br>read each interview to find ideas and experiences those young adults<br>shared. The researchers met many times to discuss the shared ideas and<br>experiences they found. Researchers discussed these ideas until they<br>agreed on what the main shared ideas (or themes) were. Two researchers<br>then reread all the interviews to match ideas with the interview quote.<br>What were the results of the study?Researchers found three ideas (or<br>themes) that all or most autistic young adults talked about. (1) Young<br>adults said that they felt stress in physical and emotional ways. (2)<br>Dealing with new responsibilities, many responsibilities, and<br>relationship problems were their main causes of stress. (3) Autistic<br>young adults said that they had different ways of dealing with their<br>stress. Some young adults used meditation and others played games on<br>their computers or phones or looked at pictures to deal with stress.<br>Many young adults also said that they get help from family and friends<br>when they are stressed out. What do these findings add to what was<br>already known?These findings help us better understand what stressors<br>autistic young adults had and how they deal with this stress. Most<br>studies ask caregivers questions about their young adults. Learning<br>about stressors and ways to deal with stress using the young adult&#39;s own<br>words is an addition to what we previously knew or what was published.<br>Furthermore, the use of Google Doc discussions to collect data is new<br>and was a good method of data collection. What are potential weaknesses<br>in the study?We only had 15 autistic young adults agree to be in the<br>study, and most were white and male. Young adults with severe<br>communication limits were not able to be in the study. How will these<br>findings help autistic adults now or in the future?We know more about<br>the ways autistic young adults feel stress and anxiety and how they deal<br>with it. This information can help service workers give autistic young<br>adults the support they need. The findings from this study can inform<br>new interventions and can help health care workers, support service<br>workers, and family members help autistic young adults deal with their<br>stress and provide more ways to deal with their life stress.<br>Introduction: Half a million autistic youth will enter adulthood over<br>the next decade. Support services to help youth successfully transition<br>into adulthood are limited and not tailored to the autistic youth and<br>young adult&#39;s needs. This study utilized qualitative methods to<br>understand how autistic young adults experience and cope with stress<br>during the transition to adulthood.Methods: The study recruited 15<br>autistic young adults aged 18-25 years. Each participant completed a<br>short demographic survey and individual interview. Interviews were<br>conducted online via Google Docs or in-person based on the participants&#39;<br>preference. Three researchers organized and coded the data using a<br>thematic approach.Results: Based on our analysis, three themes emerged.<br>Within the first theme, young adults in this study described<br>experiencing a great deal of stress and provided examples of how it<br>manifested in physical and emotional ways.

Taking these students into account, this research designed a digital mobile device application, named Fun Ocean, for a group of children between ages 6 and 12 with different levels of disability. Participants identify a list of marine animals using figure recognition techniques. Fun Ocean allows participants to interact with the iPad via finger touch and shaking the G sensor device to transfer marine animals from one iPad to another, which motivates them to learn about the defensive and offensive functions of marine animals.

It was found that Fun Ocean improved the cognitive skills of the students with special needs, and enhanced their learning interest and attentiveness.

When comparing this system to a LEGO-based non-digital intervention, it has been observed that an MR system effectively mediates a face-to-face play session between a child with ASC and a child without ASC providing new specific advantageous properties (e.g. not being a passive tool, not needing to be guided by the therapist). Considering the newly collected multimodal data totaling to 72 children (36 trials of dyads, child with ASC/child without ASC), a first goal of the present study is to apply detailed statistical inference and machine learning techniques to extensively evaluate the overall effect of this MR system, when compared to the LEGO condition. This goal also includes the analysis of psychophysiological data and allows the context-driven triangulation of the multimodal data which is operationalized by (i) video-coding of SIBs, (ii) psychophysiological data, and (iii) system logs of user-system events. A second goal is to show how SIBs, taking place in these experiences, are influenced by the internal states of the users and the system. SIBs were measured by video-coding overt behaviours (Initiation, Response and Externalization) and with self-reports. Internal states were measured using a wearable device designed by the FuBIntLab (Full-Body Interaction Lab) to acquire: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA) data. Affective sliders and State Trait Anxiety Scale questionnaires were used as self-reports. Repeated-measures design was chosen with two conditions, the MR environment and the traditional therapy LEGO. The results show that the MR system has a positive effect on SIBs when compared to the LEGO condition, with an added advantage of being more flexible. © 2021, The Author(s).</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1007/s10055-021-00580-9</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115379231&amp;doi=10.1007%2fs10055-021-00580-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0a43eb88d31a804b7e9c9fec7934051f</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Children with Autism; Embodied interaction; Mixed reality; Multi-modal evaluation; Psychophysiology; Social initiation</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Codes (symbols); Electrocardiography; Electrophysiology; Image coding; Learning systems; Mixed reality; Surveys; Video signal processing; Children with autisms; Condition; Embodied interaction; Interaction behavior; Mixed reality; Multi-modal; Multi-modal evaluation; Social initiation; Social interactions; Spectra&#39;s; Diseases</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH</div></td><td class="s4">13594338</td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Cited by: 8; All Open Access, Hybrid Gold Open Access</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45527,58032</td><td class="s7">45586,73584</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R31" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">32</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">31</td><td class="s3">Frankfurt group social communication and interaction skillstraining for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders; [Frankfurter gruppentraining sozialer fertigkeiten für kinder und jugendliche mit autistischen störungen]</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Herbrecht, Evelyn and Poustka, Fritz</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Zeitschrift fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie</div></td><td class="s4">2007</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4">33 – 40</td><td class="s4">35</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Objective: Despite the recognition of the need for group-based training programmes for children and adolescents with autistic disorders, there are only very few specific German-speaking training programmes available. Since 2003, a structured group training programme on social skills for children and adolescents with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome has been developed and conducted at our department. The training programme focuses on the main deficits of those disorders. Thus, the primary goal is to improve communication and interaction skills. Method: Participants are children and adolescents without significant cognitive and language delays. Principles of intervention include structured formats, combination of theoretical and practical elements, predictable rules, consideration of individual difficulties, and sequential and progressive learning. Techniques range from structured games, the training of affect recognition, group activities, role play, team discussions, and feedback to homework using a newly designed manual on our group-based social skill training programme and curriculum. Generally, three groups of 5-7 participants each and of different age range (children, adolescents) meet weekly / biweekly for 1-1.5 hours (excluding the holidays). Two trainers - who change during the programme - carry out each of the sessions. Trainers meet regularly with the parents to discuss experiences and to provide details of the programme. Results: Acceptance by and satisfaction with the programme are high among participants, as is the mutual recognition of and tolerance of their respective problems. Both feedback from parents and trainers&#39; clinical impressions indicate distinct improvement of verbalization and contact abilities. Participants seem to benefit particularly from role play. Conclusions: Quantitative measures (impressions of the participants, their parents and their trainers with regard to change in behaviour skills) suggest mounting interaction, communication, and problem-solving skills during the group treatment. An ongoing pilot evaluation also includes measurements of effects in everyday settings. Depending on the results, the training subsequently could be conducted and evaluated in groups with both pervasive developmental, as well as other psychiatric disorders. © 2007 by Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG.</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1024/1422-4917.35.1.33</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846541385&amp;doi=10.1024%2f1422-4917.35.1.33&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a7724078004387f13690a9ae73f8be94</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism; Children and adolescents; Group-based training; Manual; Social skills</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Adolescent; Asperger Syndrome; Autistic Disorder; Child; Communication; Female; Germany; Group Processes; Humans; Intelligence; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Pilot Projects; Program Evaluation; Psychotherapy, Group; Self Efficacy; Social Behavior Disorders; adolescent; affect; article; autism; child; controlled study; curriculum; group therapy; health program; human; interpersonal communication; learning; role playing; social adaptation; social interaction</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">14224917</td><td class="s4">German</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Cited by: 11</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45527,58032</td><td class="s7">45586,73655</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R32" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">33</div></th><td class="s7">32</td><td class="s3">Identifying the Essential Components of Strength-based Technology Clubs for Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Jones, Matthew and Falkmer, Marita and Milbourn, Ben and Tan, Tele and Bölte, Sven and Girdler, Sonya</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Developmental Neurorehabilitation</div></td><td class="s4">2021</td><td class="s4">Scopus</td><td class="s4">323 – 336</td><td class="s4">24</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Background: Strength-based technology clubs for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have become increasingly popular; however, they remain poorly described in the literature. Before the impact and benefit of strength-based technology clubs can be measured, consistency in their design and delivery must be established. This study aimed to identify the essential components of strength-based technology clubs by exploring context, mechanisms, and outcomes of existing strength-based technology clubs. Method: Twenty-three adolescents with ASD (mean age 12.96 years, SD = 1.86, range = 10–18 years), 25 parents (mean age 46.08 years, SD = 8.27, range = 33–69 years), and 20 facilitators (mean age 27.93 years, SD = 6.55, range = 20–46 years) were purposively sampled from three established strength-based technology clubs. Data were obtained via ethnographic methods, including participant observations, interviews, and focus groups. Data analysis was underpinned by a realist evaluation, which provided the context-mechanism-outcome framework. Results: Data analysis revealed that strength-based technology clubs had four context themes (personal factors of adolescents, personal factors of facilitators, personal factors of parents, institution), three mechanism themes (activity design, strengths and abilities, environment), and three outcome themes (skill building, connection with others, emotion). Conclusion: The results highlighted the importance of understanding the personal context of adolescents, providing an individualized approach, leveraging individual interests, and modifying the environment to suit the individual. The findings contributed to defining a strength-based approach within ASD, and have demonstrated that positive outcomes can be achieved by focusing on strengths rather than deficits. Future ASD services can use the results as a framework for applying a strength-based approach. The efficacy of newly designed strength-based programs can then be tested. © 2021 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">10.1080/17518423.2021.1886192</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102204969&amp;doi=10.1080%2f17518423.2021.1886192&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5ae26504df83c95215798f79384805ff</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism spectrum disorder; computer coding; qualitative research; strength-based approach; technology clubs; thematic analysis</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parents; Patient-Centered Care; Self-Help Groups; Technology; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; autism; child; clinical article; controlled study; crowding (area); cultural anthropology; emotion; environment; ethnography; female; human; information processing; interview; learning; learning environment; male; noise; parent; participant observation; </div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Taylor and Francis Ltd.</div></td><td class="s4">17518423</td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Cited by: 10</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45527,58032</td><td class="s7">45586,73627</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R33" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">34</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">33</td><td class="s3">Promoting Sleep and Balanced Screen Time among School-Aged Children withNeurodevelopmental and Mental Health Disorders: A Parent Perspective</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Blaine, Rachel E. and Bowling, April and Kaur, Raghbir and Davison,Kirsten K.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">CHILDHOOD OBESITY</div></td><td class="s4">2021</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Web of Science</div></td><td class="s4">329-341</td><td class="s4">17</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Background: Children with neurodevelopmental and mental health disorders<br>(N/MHD), such as autism spectrum, mood disorders, and anxiety, are more<br>likely to engage in excessive screen time, receive insufficient sleep,<br>and to have obesity than neurotypical peers. However, little is known<br>about how parents of these children approach promoting sleep and<br>balanced screen time.<br>Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with 24 parents of<br>children aged 8-15 years with a diagnosis of N/MHD to assess barriers<br>and facilitators to promoting sleep and balanced screen time. Interviews<br>were transcribed, double-coded using constant comparative methods, and<br>summarized into themes using NVivo 11.<br>Results: Many parents described children&#39;s chronic sleep challenges,<br>often compounded by screen use and no clear solutions. When feeling<br>overwhelmed, some parents reluctantly reported co-sleeping or allowing<br>gaming devices in bed. Nearly all participants reported chronic,<br>occasionally severe, conflict when managing children&#39;s screen time, with<br>some parents experiencing opposition and physical aggression. Parents<br>struggled to weigh the benefits of screen use (i.e., behavior<br>management, learning, and social connection) with the costs (i.e.,<br>reduced self-care and limited physical activity). To combat barriers,<br>parents described firm routines (i.e., ``screens off{&#39;&#39;} time and<br>consistent bedtime on weekdays and weekends), moderating access (i.e.,<br>shutting down internet and no device in bedroom), verbal priming, and<br>coping strategies (i.e., music and books).<br>Conclusions: Parents of children with N/MHD face unique challenges in<br>promoting sleep and balanced screen time.

We present a Computerized Assessment of Motor<br>Imitation (CAMI) using a brief (1-min), highly engaging video game task.<br>METHODS: Using Kinect Xbox motion tracking technology, we recorded 48<br>children (27 with ASCs, 21 typically developing) as they imitated a<br>model&#39;s dance movements. We implemented an algorithm based on metric<br>learning and dynamic time warping that automatically detects and<br>evaluates the important joints and returns a score considering spatial<br>position and timing differences between the child and the model. To<br>establish construct validity and reliability, we compared imitation<br>performance measured by the CAMI method to the more traditional human<br>observation coding (HOC) method across repeated trials and two different<br>movement sequences.<br>RESULTS: Results revealed poorer imitation in children with ASCs than in<br>typically developing children (ps &lt; .005), with poorer imitation being<br>associated with increased core autism symptoms. While strong<br>correlations between the CAMI and HOC methods (rs = .69-.87) confirmed<br>the CAMI&#39;s construct validity, CAMI scores classified the children into<br>diagnostic groups better than the HOC scores (accuracy(CAMI) = 87.2\%,<br>accuracy(HOC) = 74.4\%).

Since 2003, a structured group training programme on social<br>skills for children and adolescents with high-functioning autism or<br>Asperger syndrome has been developed and conducted at our department.<br>The training programme focuses on the main deficits of those disorders.<br>Thus, the primary goal is to improve communication and interaction<br>skills.<br>Method: Participants are children and adolescents without significant<br>cognitive and language delays. Principles of intervention include<br>structured formats, combination of theoretical and practical elements,<br>predictable rules, consideration of individual difficulties, and<br>sequential and progressive learning. Techniques range from structured<br>games, the training of affect recognition, group activities, role play,<br>team discussions, and feedback to homework using a newly designed manual<br>on our group-based social skill training programme and curriculum.<br>Generally, three groups of 5-7 participants each and of different age<br>range (children, adolescents) meet weekly / biweekly for 1-1.5 hours<br>(excluding the holidays). Two trainers - who change during the programme<br>- carry out each of the sessions. Trainers meet regularly with the<br>parents to discuss experiences and to provide details of the programme.<br>Results: Acceptance by and satisfaction with the programme are high<br>among participants, as is the mutual recognition of and tolerance of<br>their respective problems. Both feedback from parents and trainers&#39;<br>clinical impressions indicate distinct improvement of verbalization and<br>contact abilities. Participants seem to benefit particularly from role<br>play.<br>Conclusions: Qualtitative measures (impressions of the participants,<br>their parents and their trainers with regard to change in behaviour<br>skills) suggest mounting interaction, communication. and problem-solving<br>skills during the group treatment. An ongoing pilot evaluation also<br>includes measurements of effects in everyday settings. Depending on the<br>results, the training subsequently could be conducted and evaluated in<br>groups. with both pervasive developmental, as well as other psychiatric<br>disorders.</div></td><td class="s4">Article</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">10.1024/1422-4917.35.1.33</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Herbrecht, E (Corresponding Author), Klinikum Johann Wolfgang Goethe Univ, Klin Psychiat \&amp; Psychotherapie Kindes \&amp; Jugendalt, Deutschordenstr 50, DE-60528 Frankfurt, Germany.Klinikum Johann Wolfgang Goethe Univ, Klin Psychiat \&amp; Psychotherapie Kindes \&amp; Jugendalt, DE-60528 Frankfurt, Germany.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">group-based training; autism; social skills; children and adolescents;manual</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">VERLAG HANS HUBER</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">1422-4917</div></td><td class="s4">German</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,73089</td><td class="s7">45600,87054</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R37" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">38</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">37</td><td class="s3">Applying Asymmetrical VR Collaborative Games to the Enhancement of PeerCollaboration and Oral Communication in Children with Autism</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Yang, Wan-Chen and Lee, I-Jui</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2022</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Web of Science</div></td><td class="s4">413-426</td><td class="s4">13331</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism is a condition in which children are born with social impairments<br>in social communication, imagination, and empathy, thus, they have<br>difficulty interacting socially with peers or effectively interpreting<br>each other&#39;s intentions to engage in different social content. As a<br>result of these deficits, most children with autism are unable to play<br>cooperatively or effectively interact socially with their peers, which<br>makes them socially isolated and difficult to integrate into the<br>community.<br>In view of this, this study conducted an asymmetric VR collaborative<br>game for children with autism, where children with autism and Typical<br>Development (TD) children participated in a collaborative game in pairs,<br>and both children were required to play the game through peer<br>cooperation and oral communication. A total of 6 participants aged 7-9<br>years old, including 3 children with highfunctioning autism and 3 TD<br>children, were recruited for this study. During the game, social<br>assessments and behavioral observations were conducted by the researcher<br>and the therapist to understand whether the asymmetrical VR<br>collaborative game has an impact on children with autism in building<br>peer cooperation and oral communication skills, in order to achieve<br>outcomes that enhance social communication and trans-personal thinking<br>skills.<br>This study used an asymmetrical VR collaborative game to present the<br>game situation with different viewpoints, which allowed children with<br>autism and TD children to work together to solve the game tasks and<br>levels in a peer-to-peer and oral communication manner. In this game,<br>children with autism were required to interact socially with TD children<br>through an asymmetrical play style, thus, triggering the application of<br>peer cooperation and oral communication skills in children with autism.<br>In this game, the researcher used themicro-behaviors for video coding<br>(MBV) to observe and assess five domains, (1) mutual attention; (2)<br>meaningful conversation; (3) collaboration; (4) proximity; and (5) turn<br>taking. According to the results of this study, children with autism<br>exhibited behavioral orientations in the asymmetrical VR collaborative<br>game that were more oriented toward strengthening trans-personal and<br>empathic abilities than traditional solo play, especially in peer<br>cooperation and oral communication. On this basis, the expectation of<br>this study was that the application of asymmetrical VR collaborative<br>games had different degrees of specificity and implementation advantages<br>for children with autism in terms of social communication, imagination,<br>and empathy skills. Children with autism could learn to grasp the<br>meaning of others&#39; spoken communication, and thus, develop the concept<br>of peer cooperation during the game, which in turn facilitated their<br>mastery of social skills in all aspects of the theory of the mind.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Proceedings Paper</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">10.1007/978-3-031-05654-3\_29</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Lee, IJ (Corresponding Author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Ind Design, Taipei, Taiwan.Yang, Wan-Chen; Lee, I-Jui, Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Ind Design, Taipei, Taiwan.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism; Asymmetrical VR collaborative game; Empathy; Peer cooperationand oral communication; Peer-mediated intervention strategies</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">0302-9743</div></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">8th International Conference on Human Aspects of IT for the AgedPopulation (ITAP) Held as Part of the 24th International Conference onHuman-Computer Interaction (HCII), ELECTR NETWORK, JUN 26-JUL 01, 2022</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,73089</td><td class="s7">45600,86564</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R38" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">39</div></th><td class="s7">38</td><td class="s3">``&lt;i&gt;Xylotism&lt;/i&gt;{&#39;&#39;}: A Tablet-Based Application to Teach Music toChildren with Autism</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Elahi, Maryam Tavakol and Korayem, Amin Habibnejad and Shariati, Azadehand Meghdari, Ali and Alemi, Minoo and Ahmadi, Ehsan and Taheri, Alirezaand Heidari, Rozita</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2017</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Web of Science</div></td><td class="s4">728-738</td><td class="s4">10652</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Technology is inevitable, and its role for clinical therapists and<br>specialists cannot be ignored. The promising movement towards<br>computer-based interventions, specifically the use of tablets as an<br>effective and newly developed learning device for children with autism<br>spectral disorder (ASD) highlights the role of technology in addressing<br>the shortcomings of conventional therapy methods. In this paper, we<br>present a new application, named as Xylotism, which is an interactive<br>game to improve learning and teach music to children with autism<br>spectrum disorder. The game can be played with/without<br>parents/therapists&#39; involvement, which increases its usefulness and<br>effectiveness. We have investigated the acceptability and eligibility of<br>the application among twenty children with autism spectrum disorder. To<br>have a fair comparison a similar experiment has been performed utilizing<br>a real Xylophone. The initial results are promising, since all<br>participants accepted to play with Xylotism application and fifteen out<br>of the twenty of them preferred to use the virtual Xylophone. We also<br>video recorded the activities and coded the children&#39;s behavior, and<br>their performance in playing rhythms were measured. The results suggest<br>that the acceptance of Xylotism application is fairly compatible to the<br>real Xylophone and it has the potential to improve the skill of playing<br>rhythms in children with ASD.</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Proceedings Paper</div></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">10.1007/978-3-319-70022-9\_72</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Meghdari, A (Corresponding Author), Sharif Univ Technol, CEDRA, Social \&amp; Cognit Robot Lab, Tehran, Iran.Shariati, A (Corresponding Author), Islamic Azad Univ, North Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran.Elahi, Maryam Tavakol; Korayem, Amin Habibnejad; Meghdari, Ali; Alemi, Minoo; Ahmadi, Ehsan; Taheri, Alireza; Heidari, Rozita, Sharif Univ Technol, CEDRA, Social \&amp; Cognit Robot Lab, Tehran, Iran.Shariati, Azadeh, Islamic Azad Univ, North Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran.Alemi, Minoo, Islamic Azad Univ, We</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); Xylophone; Xylotism application;Learning music</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">0302-9743</div></td><td class="s4">English</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">9th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), Tsukuba, JAPAN,NOV 22-24, 2017</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,73089</td><td class="s7">45600,85809</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R39" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">40</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">39</td><td class="s3">DEVELOPMENT AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ``SRI BITARA{&#39;&#39;} MODULE IN IMPROVINGLITERACY SKILL AMONG REMEDIAL CHILDREN</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Kasi, K. and Aini, B.

These facial expressions were used in two different game scenarios, involving imitation and storytelling activities. The goal of these scenarios is to help the child acquire knowledge about different emotions and to improve their skill in recognizing them. The results show that these scenarios are appropriate for the goal established for this study, and positive behaviours concerning non-verbal communication were observed. This exploratory study demonstrated the possible positive outcomes this child-robot interaction can produce and highlighted the issues regarding data collection and their analysis that will inform future studies.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:246px;left:-1px">10.1109/DEVLRN.2014.6982997</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s8 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Variable speed drives;Games;Face;Emotion recognition;Labeling;Humanoid robots</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:122px;left:-1px">2161-9476</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,65922</td><td class="s7">45593,79007</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R42" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">43</div></th><td class="s7">42</td><td class="s3">An emotional learning environment for subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Bertacchini, Francesca and Bilotta, Eleonora and Gabriele, Lorella and Olmedo Vizueta, Diana Elizabeth and Pantano, Pietro and Rosa, Francesco and Tavernise, Assunta and Vena, Stefano and Valenti, Antonella</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2013</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s4">653-659</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Numerous studies highlight that serious games, 3D virtual learning environments and Information Communication Technologies can be powerful tools in supporting people affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders.

In this paper, an authoring system designed and implemented in order to stimulate and to facilitate the understanding of emotions is presented (Face 3D). This software could be a highly appropriate tool for autistic children with high cognitive functions, who are often attracted by technology.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:184px;left:-1px">10.1109/ICL.2013.6644675</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:307px;left:-1px">Autism;Educational institutions;Three-dimensional displays;Facial animation;Software;Emotion recognition;Face;Emotions;learning;autism;learning by doing;emotional learning environment;teaching/learning strategies;improving classroom teaching;multimedia/hypermedia systems;advanced learning environments</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,65922</td><td class="s7">45593,77523</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R43" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">44</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">43</td><td class="s3">Building Accessible Video Games for Children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Bagchi, Akash and Nadathur, Akshaya and Padakannaya, Pranjal and Khan, Siddiq and Khan, Siddiq</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2023</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s4">1-5</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Young children, especially those on the autistic spectrum, often do not learn educational subjects and life skills in the same manner as neurotypicals. Recreational activities like games, puzzles and co-curriculars are known to provide additional opportunities for learning while also engaging the child. The proposed project is aimed to design and implement an interactive game that will help shape the behavioral, cognitive and/or life skills of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Such an implementation will be carried out using the Unity engine, which utilizes the language C# for the source code. The final result is expected to be a working solution of a game that will aid healthy development of autistic patients in early childhood, and will be deployed for public use.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:246px;left:-1px">10.1109/ICECCT56650.2023.10179616</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s8 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:307px;left:-1px">Pediatrics;Autism;Video games;Shape;Source coding;Buildings;Games;autism;ASD;video games;game design;education</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,65922</td><td class="s7">45593,86971</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R44" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">45</div></th><td class="s7">44</td><td class="s3">Bee-{Bot} {Educational} {Robot} as a {Means} of {Developing} {Social} {Skills} {Among} {Children} with {Autism}-{Spectrum} {Disorders}</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Leoste, Janika and Tammemäe, Tiiu and Eskla, Getter and San Martín López, José and Pastor, Luis and Blasco, Elena Peribáñez</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">2022</td><td class="s4">Springer</td><td class="s4">14--25</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Lately, some high-end robots have been proposed for facilitating interaction with children with ASD with promising results. Nevertheless, most educational environments lack these robots, among other reasons, for cost and complexity considerations. In this work, a simple Bee-Bot has been used as a support tool for children with ASD who played a memory game about emotions. The main objective of the experiment was to study whether using this robot while playing the game resulted in improvements in the children verbal communication. Also, this work explored if incorporating the Bee-Bot robot to the game resulted in additional improvements in the level of child involvement in the activity.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:246px;left:-1px">10.1007/978-3-030-82544-7_2</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Springer International Publishing</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4">en</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45467,65933</td><td class="s7">45599,90216</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr><tr style="height: 16px"><th id="2021000785R45" style="height: 16px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 16px">46</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">45</td><td class="s3">Design of an Intelligent Agent to Measure Collaboration and Verbal-Communication Skills of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder in Collaborative Puzzle Games</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Zhang, Lian and Amat, Ashwaq Z. and Zhao, Huan and Swanson, Amy and Weitlauf, Amy and Warren, Zachary and Sarkar, Nilanjan</div></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies</div></td><td class="s4">2021</td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">IEEE Digital Library</div></td><td class="s4">338-352</td><td class="s4">14</td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by core deficits in social interaction and communication. Collaborative puzzle games are interactive activities that can be played to foster the collaboration and verbal-communication skills of children with ASD. In this article, we have designed an intelligent agent that can play collaborative puzzle games with children and verbally communicate with them as if it is another human player. Furthermore, this intelligent agent is also able to automatically measure children&#39;s task-performance and verbal-communication behaviors throughout the game play. Two preliminary studies were conducted with children with ASD to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the intelligent agent. Results of Study I demonstrated the intelligent agent&#39;s ability to play games and communicate with children within the game-playing domain. Results of Study II indicated its potential to measure the communication and collaboration skills of human users.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:184px;left:-1px">10.1109/TLT.2020.3029223</div></td><td class="s8"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:121px;left:-1px">Games;Collaboration;Intelligent agents;Autism;Task analysis;Electronic mail;Sociology;Adaptive and intelligent educational systems;autism spectrum disorder (ASD);collaborative learning;learning environments.</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s5 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:122px;left:-1px">1939-1382</div></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s6"></td><td class="s4 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:59px;left:-1px">Pesquisas fora do escopo de interesse</div></td><td class="s7">45525,65922</td><td class="s7">45681,89747</td><td class="s4">Rejected</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
